nice app love it but shouldn't the sims be able to have more than one hobby cuz what if you wany to be able to cook and model how does that work cant a sim have 2 hobbies max
Sims is better than expected Loved it so much. It really is worth for anyone who disagrees. Download rather than not if unsure. 
Omg This is the best game ever absolutely addicted to it on lvl28 and counting 20 Sims 2preteens 1 toddler 1baby and 16 adults I love this game so much so defiantly get it 
Love it I'm addicted. Literally go on it everyday and the quality isn't bad for a free app. Like all the tasks to do etc. Just wish they had better outfits and hairstyles haha.
The best game ever The sims is my first priority when I get onto my tablet and I have been playing this game for a bout 1 and a half years now and I have never thought of deleting this Also you might wanna try the Simpsons tapped out I also love that.
New Update I don't know what all the fuss is about. But for a FREE app, this is pretty great. People are complaining about the VIP points. They aren't forcing you to buy for vip points. It's just a good thing that they'd give back to those who actually keeps this game going with real money. Also, I'm not experiencing any game crashes so it's probably your phone's fault.
LOVE IT I love this game but it says for a task 5 ppl watch the news but I only have 2 ppl and I dont have money to buy 5 houses
