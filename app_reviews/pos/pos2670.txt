Great game Perfect little word game that you can play for a few minutes, or a few hours.
Great game with a suggestion Very entertaining and so far not difficult.   One suggestion would be to number the puzzles as I like to have a goal.  I'm glad they're not timed as I don't like pressure, but having a goal besides the satisfaction of completion would be a big plus.  For less than a buck it's fabulous though.  Thanks
Five Words Lots of fun
