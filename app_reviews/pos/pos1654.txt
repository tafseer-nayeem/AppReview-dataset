Best sports app Thanks for the score cards.  Next suggestion add favorite teams option where we can see only the news of our favorite teams
Great App Great to see such a well made sports app. What makes it better is that it's Indian. My only recommendation would be to be a little more active with notifications. Otherwise, fantastic app. Good articles too. Sportskeeda has definitely come a long way.
