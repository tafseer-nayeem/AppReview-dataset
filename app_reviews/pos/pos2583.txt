Great Strategy Game Honestly so far I'm loving every second of it. It's not overly complicated like some other tower defense games but it's by no means easy. Love it

I like it need more with hero though The hero will not move after I move him 9nce he just doesn't move which is my Main concern
This game is bugged and needs to be fixed.  It crashes instantly when I boot it up.  I have to clear all the saved data for it and then I can only play the first three levels before it crashes again.  I am on a galaxy S5.  I paid for a finished product so finish it.  It's fixed, thanks
