Amazing I am so addicted. I am thankful that this works offline. I wish I could earn more cherries another way because sometimes I have to wait hours to earn one or two cherries. Love it
Brilliant game When I first started playing this game I was a little frustrated that the cherries ran out so fast and if you wanted more, you had to buy them. However, now they have added many ways to win a lot of them so you don't have to spend your own money if you don't want to. I am hooked on this game and would give it 1010.
Kinda addictive I try to play for only a few minutes and ended up losing track of time
Love this game But the games like the cake and flowers should be more often and different types to earn different dauber along with the usual coins ect
I really enjoy this Bingo Game Finally a bingo game that gives me a chance to win and let me play as much as I want, without having to purchase anything
Love it just wish more cherries were rewarded and they would bring back the often to buy 1 or 3 cards.
Addicting I love this game. Just so everyone  knows, I had an issue with not collecting coins and cherries, I submitted an email to the support team and within a few hours I was given plenty of coins and cherries. Thanks Bingo team. YOU ROCK
Bug in game I've not been receiving all my cherries I win.  Just now I leveled up and didn't get my 2000 in coins.  Thank you.  I am not not getting the coins when I play bingo.  PS is OT giving me free coins when I watch videos it gives me one coin instead of 100. Just one coin instead of 100.
