Great game Very frustrating and addictive game. Love the music. It worth the 0.99. But once you beat both levels which will take a while download the level pack for even more fun and frustration 
Love it I am having a really hard time beating Fire Aura without checkpoints, which is good. It's a very wellmade game. I like how there isn't a lot of special effects or anything. My one complaint is that if I pause in the middle of a level and then try to come back, the music will be off and one of the jumps changes slightly. Otherwise, it's a great game
Awesome This game rocks its really hard but really cool

All u h8terz that say the game too hard and not too buy stop. Ur just mad cause u cant do it. It really is a great game I beat it. 5 starz
At first I doubted it. But I was wrong I read the comments and saw people complaining about the frame rate and lag etc. But once I downloaded it for myself, it works fine on my Samsung Galaxy S3 Totally worth 1.
