As a fellow pharmacist ,good to know that this app provides suggestions for alternate medicines available at a reduced cost
great app thanks for causing awareness and saving big money by giving cheaper alternative drug equivalents. i refer to it everytime i get a prescription from unscrupulous doctors who prescribe expensive drugs to earn additional commission.
Hello sir i just want to know if our dr recomend the medicine but if it was an expensive so can we buy the medicine we you mention as subsitube please reply
Superb app for substitute medicines
Good Love it
Good one. from comparing medicines we come to know how the doctor s are cheating the public and earning money by the way of  commission given by pharma companies. All the doctor's are prescribing only costly medicine to get more commission.
Great App Very informative and useful one. Easy to look for any drug but the info about  some of the drugs is missing.
