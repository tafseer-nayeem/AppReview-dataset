I looooove it Please can you add rachmaninoff, I'm a pianist and teacher and it's soo wonderful to have an app. to play around wIth all the songs I love to play. Thanks Please add more.
Excellent Sound works with OTA update from manufacturer The app is excellent
I love this  can't wait to get a tablet I like the new background, thank you.
Awesome The music is challenging, but I well have to agree thatjust listening to it is enjoyable
Worth the 99 Even if your phone doesn't support multi touch, the listening feature is worth the money if you are a diehard Chopin fan.
Good
