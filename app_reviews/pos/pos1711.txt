Issues with casting Google Music to Xbox One 1 I found that you have to first cast something to the xbox before using the app before Google Music shows the cast icon. 2 Google Play to xbox one fixed the same day I posted a review that it was not working  changed rating to 5 stars
Works just peachy As we all know htc one m8 is not yet fully supported by chrome cast yet , use this puppy and you,ll be streaming no probs.
Totally worth the bux I'm so glad to give my money to clockworkmod.  Allcast broadcasts any and all files to my Chromecast from all my devices, perfectly  Couldn't be easier to setup and use.  I don't always give 5 star ratings,  but when I do, I recommend  the developer to everyone.
Paid and installed App works fine.  My mistake  edit  my apologies I was running lucky patcher..  I have uninstalled this as I installed it over a year ago and haven't used it but lay on my phone..  Works fine now..  Changed my rating to reflect.. Thanks for tip
Fantastic, BUT... Please please please include a simple file browser. My music collection was ripped in the days before genreartistalbum tags were commonplace and all my music is identified by directory namefilename. I would be eternally grateful for a very simple directory browser so I can actually figure out what I'm about to listen to
