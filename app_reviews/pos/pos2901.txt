My Son loves it3yo Peg  cat,  my son loves watching the program and thought I'd see if there was an app. I would usually get the free apps but I'm fine with having paid for peg cat.  Fun tunes and great learning.
3 year old loves it My 3 year old loves everything about this app,it's one of her favorites. She surprised me with her ability to match numbers in the games
Yes My daughter loves this app
Perfection
Awsomeness My son loves pbs kids and when we go on road tips he plays this for hours. It has diffreny caracters and lots of music. It also has simple math and number problem that help him with his numbers. I love it.
Great app now that it's fixed App formatting has been fixed for the Galaxy Tab 2.  A fun app for young fans of PegCat.  Problem solved, problem solved, everything is awesome, problem solved
Mi daughter loves it Easy, fun and good quality app
Yay The update fixed it for us My kids love this game. Thanks
Huge hit My 3 year old loves it The main game will take time to learn, but the music game is perfect. The only thing I'd ask is for the note to be played more obvious.
Love it
