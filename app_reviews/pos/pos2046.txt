2nd time around 2nd time ive downloaded and played. Bought it this time so a bit confused why i  having to watch videos for pointscoins. Still a great game.
Brilliant game but why has the full version got adverts in it I thought the idea of purchasing a full version of a game was to remove adverts
Best running game But what i don't like about this game is it didn't save my stuff i did in it i had like cool stuff
Love it Buy it now as brilliant graphics awesome tricks but add multi player like someone is vector and someone is hunter that will make it more interesting
Wooow it's amazing But.... Yes it's greatest game i ever played on droid , but it's small bugs while i'm will exit the game ,pop up is blinking..use asus zenfone 5 T00F
Vector Full Its a well put together game I enjoy it and I love parkour
