Crashing
Awesome app Love u plz add updated maps of Pakistan
Can't beat it for the price
Initially a hassle finding out how to install maps but after I downloaded the free maps it went pretty smooth. Only thing I could possibly fault is that it eats away battery on a phone. Otherwise for the price, fantastic
Excellent Perfect for navigation Very precision
Great app Works great
Samsung Edge 4 UPDATE problem is resolved by removing the folder with old Routes in the StorageAndroid...                                The previous version 1.4 worked perfectly on the Edge, only crashed infrequently. After update to 1.5, it won't even launch...
