But..... I really really want a baby but they are way to expensive plus I think you should be able to buy pets as well like in a pet store and one more thing it would really be cool if you could actually dance at the clubs like a little mini game or something. Thanks for reading this and please please make some adjustments.
I Love it BUT ... It is way too  difficult to go up the lists and get stars.  Takes forever and I don't really care for my character being called a bottom feeder or crawled out of the gutter and getting dollar bills from garbage cans and bird droppings. I really want a freaking CHEAT and NOW so I can enjoy this game and get where I can have some fun with it.  Kimmy's already made 200 million from this.  I think she can be more generous with stars and list rising.
This is my favorite game ever Im about to get married next week Need some slight cash and get a baby maybe and im level 12 and i own a malibu suite beach house place and im a D lister so you could say that im having some fun
Love it You set up a promotion. Double cash this weekend but it's not workin. This sucks I have had many problems with the game. It has randomly restarted and I lost everything it's been two weeks and still I haven't recovered everything I had. One more mess up and I'm done.
Kim Kardashian This game is very interesting i love the way its set up and its incredibly awesome just one thing maybe you should make willow pape a little more jealous
Love love love love love Super cool This game inspires me and boost my confidence tremendously. Thanks Kim, thanks to all of her family  her entire team for supporting her 
Best game ever. But  is there other way to get full energy, star and money without hack or trying to do some dumb survey download I think it the best game ever, that easy.... I love it lol.... but it takes to long for the energy to get up fast enough fix that please thanks
