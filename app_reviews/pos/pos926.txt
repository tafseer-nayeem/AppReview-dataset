Super cool I've always wanted to go out and explore the setting around me but never really knew where to start. This app takes you to some cool places and it's actually so cool that they have literal containers set up all around the world. Super fun and super cool
Love the app love the game I never rate apps but I love this app  much so I give it a 5 I recommend chatchers to use this app and ppl get get and join geocatching
Awesome. It does a great job and works extremely well. It is so much better than the Windows Store version.
Got me hooked I started off with this free app not really knowing anything about this caching world. Not long after I had begun I sucked my sister into it also.  Two old ladies caching Australia... Well, Vic and Tas so far. I upgraded to the full membership and it worked perfectly. No issues here. Got so many more caches to find now. Thanks. I love it
