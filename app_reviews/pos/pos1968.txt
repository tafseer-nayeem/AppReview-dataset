Too good Absolutely brilliant couldn't get any better this update is literally the best yet. Outstandingly outstanding  
AWSOME I just won the golden blade and on zen mode I scored 1012 points. Try to beat that
I was at a place telling a guy to not delete this game because my mom bought a thing on this game and someone else said that this game is really great
Maybe some day I would be a ninja It's a fun app. Actually, I don't like the app. Just kidding. Everyone hates this dumb crap. Just kidding. Everyone rates this app zero stars just kidding. Everyone thinks it stupid just kidd.............. I love it
QUESTION If I am to delete app then reinstall it and sign into the account I have will i be able to get all my blades and dojos back ' 
Fruit Ninja I have a 64 GB phone but this is not the case for some people... The MB required should be reduced so everyone can enjoy.
More new things Ive complete all and even got so much money and king dragon blade. Its getting boringplz have more blades that are much expensive and anything that let us player excited for long Thanks
db I didn't think Halfbrick could make Fruit Ninja more fun,  but they went above and beyond my expectations.  Great job on an awesome app  
Best game ever A couple of years ago I used to play this all the Time but now I PLAY IT 24 7 365
I understand how that feels I used to not have enough storage on my nook because I put too many downloads and BTW I am such a fan ArianaGrande
Absolutely  great This is such fun it's cool slicing fruit I love slicing fruit and Congratulations   on your fifth year of this game
