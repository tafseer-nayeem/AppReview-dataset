Easy and fun to use I've had the same hair style since I was 5, so I liked seeing something different
Great hair style tool Easy to use ..and as good as the online version ..except it only does hair. But for what it does it's fun and user friendly and helpful when picking a new look.
Love this I like trying on these looks then I can take to my hair dresser to get the look
Definitely worth paying for. Tiny tweakstofit make this the app that actually does what you hoped the others would do.
