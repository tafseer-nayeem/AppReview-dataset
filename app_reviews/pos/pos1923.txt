ok thanks, it's working again. Thank you for the quick support
Great
Poate cea mai bun aplicaie meteo i merita toi banii. Felicitri  Dac sar putea face setri separat pentru ceas culoare, fonturi, etc. ar fi minunat.
Useful and customizable
Like the real thing I'm a 'weather geek' and this is very much like having a pricey weather station in your back yard. Very customizable and accurate. Got it about 3 years ago and still love it. Five stars.
Weather Station This just keeps on getting better Nice, clean new GUI.  An excellent app, particularly for those with  a PWS who like to checkin when not at home. Improvement requests have been answered very swiftly by the developer. Superb
Great App for the weather enthousiasts. Improved the maps and now load faster  Thanks for keeping the improvements coming
Love it Professional look, and user preferences and options are impressive.
Great. Finally, I found a weather app that is excellent and has a good widget.
Very professional Very nice
Fantastic Love it it's all right there don't need to dance between screens. Just 2 miner things when you put the temperature on Fahrenheit it reads Celsius and the time always shows am not am or pm nothing to really lose sleep over other than that fantastic
Better than a home weather station Great app, better than an actual home weather station, love the history graphs, plenty of settings to customize how you want.
Love this app. This one is a bargain.  Well laid out,  easy to read.  5 star,  no doubt.
