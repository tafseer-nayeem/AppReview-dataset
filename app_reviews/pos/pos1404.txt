Works well. There is a learning curve, because some cards are not very legible. It gets easier with practice. The image is saved along with the contact so you can always look at the card itself later. I think that's very handy. It syncs with my google contacts or any social media so it's a really cool program.
Works when you need it to Brilliant time saver, works when it has to 95 accuracy. Brilliant for someone who gets a load of cards and needs contact info at their fingertips. Brilliant
Good scan accuracy This program saves a lot of time.  All business cards are different.  Many contain information in graphic form.  After a scan,  this program opens an editing screen allowing for immediate correction of errors.   I love the Salesforce Intigration.  Sending information to several databases is the real time saver.
