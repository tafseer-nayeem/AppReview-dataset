I am new to this app. I hope they accommodating, with special needs. My son is Autistic.. How has anyone's experience been with them Spirit was a horrid nightmare We flew with them last year. They had my Autistic son, so upset we almost had to cancel our flight. On flight my blood sugar was down to 45. I asked the flight attendant for some oj and why I needed it. I was told its only for alcohol drinks I even said I would pay for it. They said no.
