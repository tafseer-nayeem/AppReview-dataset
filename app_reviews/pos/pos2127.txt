Good app Not sure why all these people are leaving negative ratings, the cards are not slow it must be your device. The game doesn't reset and I've never got a popup ad, just the ones at the top of the screen and all apps have some ads unless you'd like the app to not be free Stop complaining people, it's a good, free solitaire game and there's nothing wrong with it 
Yes I would give this game 7 stars if I could but unfortunately I'm not able to. I'm not sure who I can get in touch with to increase the amount of stars awarded to an app or game. If anyone knows, please contact me and I'll follow your instructions. Then and only then can we be friends.
It is a very quite peaceful game no going crazy and it helps you get smarter I got sure recommend it to all of you people that need quite time but the one problem is me can someone teach me how to play multiplayer if there is not multilayer I give 3 stars but I am not sure I'd there is so I will be nice and give 5 stars
SOLITARE Excellent way to kill time when waiting in line at the supermarket or sitting in the courthouse, perfect stress reliever...... DOWNLOAD IMMEDIATELY YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED..........
Great ...no dragging cards to move Lots of fun....this is a good version where you can tap on a card and it automatically moves for you instead of having to drag it like some other versions. This is a good solid version of a great classic game 
Good...very entertaining and enjoyable.  Good way of slowing down your boredom
Don't understand the negative reviews This is solitaire, plain and simple. If you remember playing classic windows solitaire with no fancy songs but just simple fun, this is the app for you. Does what it says on the tin perfectly. Ads are not intrusive.
Had to uninstall because my tablet was running out of room Finally got it back, nothing negative about this game.
