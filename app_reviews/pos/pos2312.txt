Awesome .. worth it Perfectly like an harmonium... thnx a ton for making this... was sesrching it from ages... thank a lot for the creators... the once complaining about delay should know that this is how harmonium works... please dont change anything its perfect..
I loved this app. Those who are complaining about delay of keys should understand that this is not an electronic keyboard. You need to understand the transaction between two notes. The delay, is the characteristic of harmonium and you should know how to use it
