Fun Games Really fun set of games.    YOU DONT KNOW JACK 2015 1 of the 5 games can be crude and not family friendly.  But the rest so far seem to be really really fun  Worth the price.
Great set of games for Android TV. Great for small parties.  You just need one laptop, phone, or tablet per person. You might want to keep some chargers on hand, because it's hard to put down.
Best thing I own on my Nexus Player. An absolute blast to play this at gatherings.
Tons of fun Had a blast playing this with friends over. Definitely worth the money
What a fantastic game for a family with older teens. This has been a great way to bring us together for some laughs.
