So done Lol i just started playing and within the first few minutes i beat the hard bot 3 times im a row  its not always fun being a genius but I'll keep it and challenge my friends
I like tictactoe but sometimes it makes me feel frustrating and I get the upset so I go on to home and play another game. And also my mom let me get 10 points but Lisa, the other player got 2 points. I told her thanks. I was pretty much proud of her but my mom could get me more than 10 points.
Good and uh Very addictive and fun. The computer is so very very easy even on hard mode. But it's tough when you let the computer move first. All in all love it but it'd be better if there were challenges like win a game in 10 seconds or something like that. But appart from that still love it.
Sad childhood Yep. I don't need a pencil and paper anymore. I would tend to bring a pencil and pad to do it on long rides but whenever I wanted to play, sometimes no one wanted to play with me when I was younger. Mainly because they were to busy on something else or something. Now I can play this on my phone and it's a one player or two player and is entertaining. I like playing against the computer.
Good game Very entertaining I dont regret downloading it .My all time favorite , I love it
