Well that's a work out. Well it work for me just fine.. ps4 and connected with my galaxy s6 edge.
I had this idea a couple years ago I had no issues connecting to my Wii u over the wifi, app works very well.
 it dowsnt even work,  what the heck.. i wish i could've given this a 0. jist because im mean like that,  BUT THERE A REASON.  .. the app works just fine with apple devices,  but i dont have an apple device..  obviously if im trying to download this on my phone.  but ny brother has one and it works just fine. whenever i open the apo to join the game, it always crahses.  when i say always, i mean ALWAYS. please fix this .
More accurate control than the regular Wii remote As the Wii U version has no support for Wii motion plus a rather silly move, Ubisoft, using this app gives you,  in my opinion,  more accurate control in comparison. Your mileage may vary on PS4 and Xbox one,  but it's a nice to have when you're in a pinch,  nevertheless.
It works people We tried it without the camera on PS4 and it work fine maybe yall just don't know how to work it.
After seeing the reviews, it seems mostly people who are complaining about it are Xbox 1 users... Works perfectly on my Ps4 
It really works When I played the game in my Wii U and play it. It really worked
Working, loving it. The demo version didn't though 0 which made me sceptical of even trying in the first place. Happy I did 
Tried the demo for my daughter and she loves it no problems with my ps4 also worked fine with both 2015 and 2016
Awesomness I love it DO MORE please
