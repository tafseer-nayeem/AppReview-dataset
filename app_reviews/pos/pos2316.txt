Great update You made the game much better. Thanks Really fun Finally Just Dance for smartphones                                             FOR PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT LAG this game is CPU intensive, your computer should have a fast CPU anything above 2.8GHZ so the game doesn't lag Internet connection has something to do with it but the game LAG comes from an old and weak CPU.
great keeps me entertained, loved the calories meter. really fun  i love the fact that we can unlock the songs by using coins instead of limiting us to those few songs. great work keep it up 
Loved it , but  The best app But no matter how good I dance My phone detects low and I always get a lower rank
The Best Update Yet This is one of the best games on smartphone. Before the update, we were limited to 3 free songs a day and other locked songs needed VIP Pass to play them. But now I can unlock all the songs I wanted with coins thanks to the update Plus, the score is now correctly synced  Although both the app and the second screen have ads, I don't really mind because the game is so addictive.
I LOVE IT Please add more songs. I used this one time and I love it so far. Keep up the good work. It is the best way to get going. I'm not getting rid of this anytime soon. It is awesome I love it. Thanks for the best way to dance without the game and remote. I love it please add more songs 
Excellent Its so good fun dancing with my nephew. I had been enjoying to challenge the world. Love it.
UPDATE IS AWESOME Molim vas izbrisite VIP i dajte ove 2016 pesme za 500coins PLZZZ.
THANK YOU Finally leveling up gives you coins to get songs. Thank you so much for letting us get songs without VIP because I DO NOT WANT TO SPEND MONEY thanks
