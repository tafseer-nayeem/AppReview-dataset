Essential windsurfing app Forecast is always right and worth paying for to get additional models with hourly detail. If you are having problems logging in then just uninstall then re install. This worked for me after a few failed logins. It's not a fancy UI but it's fast and detailed.
Almost perfect Just needs the tide data in the column along with wave, rain and wind data. Then to top it off could do with a couple of sweet widgets. Still the best surf and weather predictor around. Clear, concise and detailed at the same time.
Great app Bit slow when loading forecasts but 99 percent accurate.
Perfect app After the latest update it is again working as it should.
Wind Guru Awesome app. Spot on every time 
Very accurate The user interface may not be the most modern one, but the forecasts are really accurate most of time. Excellent app for sailing
