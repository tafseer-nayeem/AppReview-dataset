Great tool Love this because I'm very calorie conscious so now I can deduct calories burnt during my walk from my daily intake  another ounce of steak 
Good one Just you need to set your step length and keep screen open in settings.
My favorite walking app Counts every step accurately and does exactly what I need it to do
Just what I was looking for So far, so good.. Keep me on track to my goals
Greay app for walking I tried a couple of apps and this one works the best.
Works most excellent, counts every step. Samsung Active  Kyocera Duraforce
Mike I love it. It does just what I want it to do and when I want it to do it. Thank you.
Very happy Today's update fixed the wildly accelerating step count, and I'm back to loving this app It uploads directly to MyFitnessPal, and shares to social media so I can keep myself accountable for my progress. Well done, Runtastic
Have to bump it up since it's logged more than 1.5 million steps. I had to reset my phone twice. Never lost any data when I restored it. All my sessions were restored. For those that are complaining, you need to have an account at Runtastic for this to work. Still counts when the screen is off. I'm using Lollipop.
My fitness pal Brilliant lost 11lbs last month with it.
Great tool. As long as you program the app with your stride length and keep your location services on, this app is pretty accurate to number of steps, distance and speed.
Fab app Counts calories, steps and distance.  Pleased with this app.
