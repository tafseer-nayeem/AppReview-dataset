Does the job. Don't know why this has a 3.7 rating. It works and it's just a HD display of fish in a fish tank. So I can't score less than 5 because it does exactly what it says. Someone said it's crap cos the tank is dirtyhello, it HD. Think you need to clean your TV screen or something.
Love it app runs continuously even whn wifi is off.
Geat Works great, now I have a floating fish tank in my room
Very relaxing app Works great. Just like having a real aquarium in your home without the hassle.
There's fish on my Chromecast App does exactly what it advertises.  I'm okay with that.
Awesone It's like a real fish tank in my wall
Wonderful..love scene..also enjoy the sound
Exactly as described.  
Good app, nice developers. I didn't think I'd like the audio, but I was wrong. It's a nice, soothing background noise. Thanks for including the option to toggle it
Nice Just wish it had sounds for it. Now that's fast,  just asked for sounds a few hours ago and now it has it.
Ocean HD'sgood but this is real Bangin realtime fish not cgi real fishtank video. Long enuff n  beautifully looped so its Virtually unoticable. Only complaint, No clock n only 2 tanks. Otherwise perfect. Looks like a real life salt water fish tank. Superb n well worthva buck
Nice relaxing app, even the audio is peaceful. Can this be set up to auto play as a background when the chromecast isn't being used to view tv
Do u like my aquarium This is an awesome app. Bring ou more aquariums as it's calming.
For 99 cents,  it's a five star app It's worth the 99 cents just for the comedy value.  Plus,  little kids love it.
Loving it Really superb idea of the Dev. .. Make some more beautiful backgrounds. ..thanks
Note4 Real nice for the price
