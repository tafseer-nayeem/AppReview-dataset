Need a toddler version My toddler 2 year old loves this game but he can't save the pandas on later levels.  Please could you make a version with only 5 levels max but with unlimited lives. I would pay for this He really wants to save the pandas but the tantrums when he runs out of lives is exhausting.
it's so much fun and I love achieving new things but kinda glitchy sometimes
Great game.. stupid x's and o's My x.. the totally conceited yet insecure know it all victim.. whom I adored.. introduced me to this game one night while we were snug as a bug in a bed sorry, my 5 yr Olds fav mommy saying where we played for like 5 hrs.. no glitchin..just awesomeness that me a 26 yr old can enjoy as well as my 6 yr old. Banging app
Very addictive and fun. Have 2 issues though. 1.You only get five lives and it takes forever for them to refresh. When you do the levels w the death bubbles another thing I don't like you can go through those lives fast. Getting new lives should be every 10 min max. 2. I agree about the coins. I can't get any power ups bc there's no way to earn coins. We should be able to earn them in some way. Ex downloading apps, watching videos, etc. And also being awarded 25 coins when we complete a level.
Not playing for me I haven't played this game in awhile due to it malfunctions. Please fix so that I can continue to play. Thanks
Why don't friends show up any more that have played so I can send them lives
Love playing the game. Have a few problems with the game, but it's the same  with all of them. Fun and Addictive play a little too much.
