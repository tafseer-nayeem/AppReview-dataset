Love it Both me  son love this app. Not perfect of course but if you want to play chess on your phone... Good enough.
Best chess game ever I have never played such a great chess game in my life Very fun and is good for all ages and levels because you can change the difficulty to match you perfectly
Does the job Simple to use, graphics aren't amazing but let's face it, you're not playing chess for graphics. 1 and 2 player games available and an AI that can be amended dependent on your ability level
Great Easy to use  and starts up really quickly to provide enjoyable game. One of the best apps I've come across.
Great chess app Good AI engine. I hate the fact that a software beats me frequently. All in all, I am satisfied.
Amazing game love it One of the best chess apps i have ever played. I love this game so much. Especially because you can undo your mistake.
This is for beginners or pros Simple to use, make it as easy or difficult to use as you need.
Keeps me entertained when I'm bored So much fun I can play it in the car while or when I'm bored I also just play it for fun sometimes.
Best game Worth appreciating game well done developers. Very good game for  those who want to become high level  player .
