Really cool game, good time passer I know there's lots of ads but just try to appreciate the actual game. If you really can't stand the ads, either buy no more ads but it only gets rid of most of them or put it on airplane mode
Great game I always wanted to play this but didn't have the right phone to play it, now that I do its awesome
BULL CRAP YEAH I LOVE ANGRY BIRDS THE ONES THAT HATE  THE GAME IS GAY OR ELSE ILL PARTY
Challenges in each level makes this game fun to play , the best part is you can play offline  later save your game data  no loss of data
Amazing I remember when I downloaded just a simple game on my very old ipod. Oh boy has this gone through a lot And about the ads, turn on airplane mode. Sure you can't receive calls or use wifi, it's worth it to have at least have some fun on this game
I love the way you make this I ti hink you guys are great.  I don't care about the haters they suck.
Fun game very addictive Its really fun but adds are definitely a problem.
The only thing that I don't like about it is that the birds are not very good and they need to be bigger and the levels need to be easyer.
I think it's a good app and I think that rovio should make an big bang theory tv showand ninja turtles 2014 movie version of angry birds
Game for life right here First thing I get everytime I upgrade my phone. Must have
Angry Birds What looks easy can demand a bit of skill. The player may become frustrated, but is never bored. I always find Angry Birds a great way to pass the time. Most adverts allow a skip click.
ANGRY BIRDS I LOVE THEM ALL ESPECIALLY THE The first two are the best. I really love to relax to the destruction I CAUSE THEM WITH OUT MERCY. THEY GET SMASHED IN SUCH GREAT STYLE. GREAT PERFECTION ON DETAIL DOWN TO EVERY BOARD OF WOOD OR EVEN A BUNSON BURNER.
Angry Birds I think that all you guys out there reading my comment should defiantly get it if you haven't...
