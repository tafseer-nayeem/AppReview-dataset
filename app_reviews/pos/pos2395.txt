Love this game Get this game it's fun you could unlock new cars , trucks,tanks. And stuff if you hate this game you are wrong so, download this game for free. Hope you have a great time
Pretty decent time waster I enjoy the game, physics are a bit wonky, and the music slightly tiring, but other than that, i like it. The ads that do pop up aren't ridiculous and ear rapey, and you have the option to close them. Quick, to the point, and simple. 1010
Big time spender This game is great for wasting time it also is runs great with vary little problems it gets a little laggy but other then that is has no problem
It is really fun but it takes forever to get a lot of coins . hill climb racing is more easier to get coins and now the cars are a lot ....... More expensive
Cool game Smooth play, good fun, cars are a too expensive to get without having to spend money though
EXCELLENT LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  THIS  GAME
Amazing I love how the game is so smoothly made. I love it for long car trips. I let my children use this app when they are bored, and they love it. Thank god for video games
