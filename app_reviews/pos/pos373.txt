So epic This game is awesome  But maybe it would be better if you could select more ingredients at once
Toca Boca Rules I don't usually leave reviews, but I have to say that I love all of the Toca Boca apps They are so well made, the developers really put a lot of thought and time into these games. Thank you for making great apps that my daughter loves to play. And so do I, not even gonna lie.
Even more fun than hair salon 2 I installed this for my daughter but I can't put it away
The  most fun game Me and my kids can play this 4 hrs and it's just as funny as when I first downloaded it. I think that this is my favorite  game I've purchased.

Toca Boca Hair Salon This game is the best I have ever seen from Toca Boca.

Suggestion. If you could use the way that the eyes and mouth move in another app, it would be awesome to be able to talk with your pictures
