My favourite so far. The Isabella TTS Vox has a nicely balanced pitch, and it's pronunciation is pretty good. I'd rate it slightly higher than its other US TTS female counterparts. Its compatibly with other apps that have a vox utility is great too.
Love it.. I have the same voice in my pc..
Great TTS program Love this. Clear sound and easy to use
Very nice. Very lifelike and clear. Navigation works now.
Awesome Very realistic. Great job
