I really love being able to take Google's ecosystem into my own car Android Auto might still be in its early stage but that that doesn't mean it hasn't saved me from a tight spot or two Also, for any of you who might be having trouble with your car taking a while to connect to your phone try the Triple Brake technique Have your handbrake on  Have your car on Park mode  Step on the brake. Make sure your seatbelt is on, connect your phone and Android Auto should show up instantly in your car
Works great Any chance it can be more customizable The screen is too bright, i would like to set it to night mode all the time, it would be good to see the speed limit or at least how fast i am going, it would be nice to have a list of travel options so i can choose my route and see where all the traffic is easily.
Great I love it. I believe that the update just changed it for night driving, for it was too bright. Hopefully, I am right and I do not have to go back and edit it. UPDATE I was wrong, but it's been updated again. I am crossing my fingers. The 5 star review stays until I see it tonight UPDATE Still Great
WORKS AMAZING WITH S6 EDGE It works perfectly with my s6 edge only down side is that you can't watch videos or use any mainstream app like youtube. Other than that it's spot on. Google maps is amazing and Spotify works perfectly.
