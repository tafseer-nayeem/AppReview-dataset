Addicted. Would really like to buy deadpool but I'm not offered it anymore. Please offer the bundles again. I will definitely drop the money on them. But other than that the game is great.
Love it Addictive game. The graphics are insane.  Alot of Champions you can get.   A lot easier to get 3 star champion.
Awesome It's a great game An easily accessible simple to play basher, it can get a little repetitive and as with most games you have to pay to get the most out of it but nonetheless a thoroughly enjoyable game
This game is cool but it's bullshit when it comes to rewarding you with players they say they'll give you
Addictive. Fun. Would be nice if could get class catalysts easier, if got one for completing rather than 100 explored or random esp as can only get opportunity once a week. Also not a fan on new increase required for rank rewards on arena. Means Either need ALOT of characters or actually make that and need to play ALOT. Highly recommend finding a decent alliance to join though.
Awesome Everyone who doesn't understand this game is moronic, you play the game, get in an alliance and build your roster.....simple. best marvel game on android and getting champs is so much easier than it used to be. I have been playing since december 2014.
Sooo fun This games really run, rage inducing at times, but thats usually due to irresponsiveness most likely of the device, it's highly addictive a.k.a fun, I have 1 complaint which is how hard it is to get new heroes, but thats part of the game so still 5 so fun  thanks
Ummm... what's wrong with all the Vision So whenever I use a 1 and 2 special attack and whenever any character blocks it, it literally does no damage this is the only character I'm having problems with. Also you should add more characters like elektra, shehulk carnage...
