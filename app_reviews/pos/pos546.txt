Helps me alot I can get game invites and messages on my phone when im not even on my ps4
Samsung galaxy note 2Great app Best app by Sony Missing one thing from the new update and that's a community part It would be nice to check my communities on the go
Awesome but.... Can fault the app so far the only thing that I'd recommend is enabling a copy text function. I'm online when alot of non English speakers are on and its be great to be able to copy text to translate or build in a auto translate function so the great PSN can communicate.
App Is Amazing But I Cant Leave Group Chats Is Annoying Need To Be Fixed
Overall Awesomeness Restarts when I try to change my profile picture. Also when I click on other Things. Not Really Important, but I Love This App. PS Over XB
