Another awesome game I've been playing your games since the Xbox game Jurassic park and this game inperticular there is so much to do but the only downside about this game is packs are expencive
It doesnt work When I enter the game it exits back out and says unfortunately jw stopped working but I still love the game ive watched people play it
It's addictive, but need stability The game is phenomenal, but there is a couple problems the games crashes from time to time especially on the note 3 and 4. The card packs are way way to high, if they made card packs between. 1, 2, 5  10 dollars they would make so much more money too. Good works guys and gals just needs a little work.
THANK YOU it finally supports my phone now. Thank You so much I've been playing rise of berk and jurssic park builder but I really wanted this game soo bad bec. I liked the movie a lot.Keep up the good work Ludia. pls have an update on battle mode, please make it similar with the battle on jurassic park builder 
Jurassic world.     And it is too hard to get DNA three at a time doesn't help nothing, need to make it better  and as for the dinosaurs fighting the game cheats the lower dinosaurs he got  can beat your  higher dinosaurs no that's no coincidence
