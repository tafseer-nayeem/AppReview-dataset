Awesome app Always accurate. Never crashes.  Mist trusted and accurate weather app. If it says it will rain in twenty minutes it's going to rain in twenty. Give or take a few minutes.  Blows my mind how accurate it is.
Great weather app I think this the best weather app available. I just wish that the home screen widget color was customizable or something other than white, wish it could be transparent. Maybe that option could be integrated into an update sometime in the near future Love the app, I won't use anything else.
Very accurate It provides better informations as compared to different apps. Very customized and helpful.. kudos..
Sharknado Storm's dying down. How can you tell Not as many sharks flying around.
Accuweather Plus Very accurate with temperature and severe weather warnings.
The best out there. Period.
Easy and quick It's an excellent app that does what it says it does.
Excellent  app.. I am very happy using this app.
Still loving it This is an awesome app
