Fun and simple to use I really like this app Its really fun to design cute wallpaper for my phone. Works great.
Monogram It Make your monogram..save and send to your pc and import into your cameo...works great..
I have made some absolutely gorgeous backgrounds using this app. Everyone who loves monograms should get this. The best 99 cents I have ever spent. Deserves more than 5 stars
No complains about this app, it's just what I was looking, I only wish that the part where you put your name could be moved to wherever you want on the screen. It's overall good, i'd recommend it
My daughter loves this app She says that she wishes there was an Olaf sticker for summer. I even created one for myself and not that I have it as my background, I just saved it on my daughter's tablet and I'm very surprised by all the amazing fonts and backgrounds. Thanks, Firelit Studios.
Love this app Love this app but think it's time to add some more new backgrounds
