Needs a better product description Took me forever to figure out how to use this app. I had no idea what it meant by adding another pad  but figured it out after a while. The original app doesn't explain how it works nor does the app description.   I almost returned it but I finally figured out how it works. Good ad on.
Superb app This is one of those apps that I always download immediately after getting a new android phone.  Has defined how I use android.
Good application Good application for quick switching between running apps. However on Samsung Appolo I5800  it has a lag few seconds long. Therefore it is not so quick. I can see EMPTY for a few seconds and then the list of latest apps shows. It would be great having this function is as instant as possible. It would be the best  to have an option to choose the ratio of  performancecpuram consumtion. Anyway, keep developing  I am happy with your work.
one of my fav app... i was looking for this kind of app ..when BB Z10 BB flow released P .. 5 star from me...
Great app I use this app instead of the task manager on the Galaxy S3. I hated the need to long press the home button. Now a single swipe gives me the same result.
Youtube not showing up Opened youtube about three times but it didn't show up in the recent items pad. Please fix.
The recent tasks doesn't work on z3 lollipop
Excellent. Took me two minutes to figure this one out. Love how simple yet efficient it is.
