Not so bad after all. It is still needs a lot of improvement when using android, example  there' isn't any 'edit auto text' .  way to go....good luck
Update You should make it possible for us bbm users to slide the pictures, don't you think It's so not funny if you have to close the pic you're looking at to open another, its definitely easier to slide through the next pic right Please consider this deeply. Thanks
Great app Now we can get to pick more than one smiley... Brava. The voice calls are still poor but I its cool
Great Had BBM for iPhone and the Android version is head and shoulders better. Dare I even say that it's probably better than the BB10 version I use this regularly for friends and family still on their Blackberrys, new and old.
Best Messaging app People go for viber and whatsapp but those apps drains battery like hell. BBM only needs to add some emotion packs.
Too cool Its easy  friendly to use. Faster than the former one. Love it anyway
