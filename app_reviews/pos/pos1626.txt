Great app.  Use it all the times . Only thing I don't like is that they do that update all jordan prices and stuff fast. They take long time to update them Other then that it's good app.
Amazing app If I can't get my favorite Jordan's instore, I can always rely on this app to help me locate and buy from legit re sellers The price guide also helps spot over priced sneakers
Sneaker heads Best shoe app ever for Js Kobes Brons
GREAT APP It's a awesome app just wish they had all Jordans like the Son of Mars Series Yall need to put the add to cart bot on here as well and I would buy that too
Awesome app If you like shoes like jordan nike and lebrons this app is great
Finally... All it's working well
Good app Works great, add more shoes like roshes, huarache and make an option to change the currency
It was a good app It was a good app but i added a case to my collection and now it wont open the app
