Optimistic guy.... Nice....I like it....hope aviary group will be improved a lot. Resolution should be increased.... obviously pics quality will good. You have to increase some effects.. If I say a good photo editor after instagram then I'll say Aviary..
First time editor Super user friendly. Great Job...I never comment on or rate apparently but this is nice
free for sure do I get to pay for the FREE effects after 1615 Im afraid I would be billed through my account I dont have money to pay 
Great add on There is really nothing negative I can find to say about ANY aviary product.
WHY RATE WHEN GOOGLE CAN ALREADY ACCESS Access to my personal data is out of my control. Or doesn't anyone read and comprehend the applications access once installed Platform protocols are the end of democracy and moral society.
Perfect I absolutely love this addon It has the best range of filter effects, and it's free Don't give these guys bad reviews if you, quote, can't find the app, or can't open it. These and others by Aviary are simply addons for the photo editor app, so you can't physically open it. It's in the effects list in the effects section of the editor app I will give 5 stars on all of their effects. And please, tell other Aviary users what I told you.
 My go to photo app. Downloaded Aviary years ago and I've loved it since
