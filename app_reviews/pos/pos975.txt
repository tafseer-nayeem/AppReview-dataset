THE BOMB This app blew me away. Thank You Money well spent on the pro version
Really works for me Love the app so much. The position is exactly match with the stars I see in the sky. Thank you
Best Best out of the top ones. Glides and is smooth. Awesome planet inserts as well to help you find planets.
Works very well Works very well as long as your not around a big chunk of metal like an automobile....
Loved it Its very user friendly and helpful when im outside without my telsscope on hand.
Awesome This is awesomeness personified I don't understand why Google sky map has more downloads than this I would absolutely recommend this app It's amazing.
Love the app, use it on my iOS and Droid devices
Changed my tune After spending some and learning how to use it, I realize that it is nicer than Google Sky. More refined and more features.
Nice app Love the ability to take pictures.
Great app Please make even closer to location
Sky view Excellent app for star gazing
Very exciting to see the out line of the stars,it will be nice to able to be in the house in winter  and see the stars like I was outdoor.  my friend told me about this app
Works great on my Lg g4.
Not bad... It's a slick app...
