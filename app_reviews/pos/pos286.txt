Brilliant game Youre so liars,this is the best game had ever seen And the opponent its not to fast because sometimes i won against my opponent,OkAnd the time that it takes the person of the game to heal is important,and dont be morons in the time that it takes you can take a brake for breath and continue playing And of course the controls are so good,OkSo shut up,such a very impatient liars
Rolando Thompson love it. This game is great do not listen to these haters man me and my brother play with this game like every day they are hating on it probably because they phone or something is not working well . So you should get the this game its really funny too.
This game is great Warning it takes guts and thinking and perfect timing which I am great at I am  at season  seven do not worry you will get there but there is one incy problem Kaley ray is kind of right and let's not be rude about it
Nice game.. reminds about the show I have completed all the levels in thr game... awesome it ia.. liked it very much. Just wondering when would new levels be introduced. Just one concern,  it is hard to earn enough ballsy bucks to unlock all characters.
Best game ever  ............not I frieken hate really hard on seasone two and can pass it I hate it so mucch f... thus game.
Runs perfectly I'm not sure why so many people are complaing about glitches  controls. Maybe their phone just sucks because it runs flawlessly on my old HTC One M8. Fun game
Cool It is a cool app but I do get frustrated sometimes because it makes you die to easily
