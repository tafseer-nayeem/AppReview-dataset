Great This works just fine, don't know why people are complaining, maybe stop using 4 year old phones and it will work better.
Good To those complaining of lag,  just adjust the latency in settings...
Simon 6 sack just for lag lol love it singing is my cool jazz heheheheheheheheheh 
Can't complain It works just fine really don't know why you guys are complaining about, maybe it's your mobile phones that has a problem not the app.
Works well with latest updates Was struggling to find microphones to buy, found this app instead. Aces
Really Nice It works. Just connect your phone and your PS3 to the same WiFi network and open this app on your phone. Now you can play sing star on your PS3 even if you don't own a mic. Enjoy
I love frozennnnnnnnn The only reason I wanted this app for ps3 and ps4 only for my favourite dong let it go in frozen i love frozennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn and elsaaaaaa too
Its really fun It's quite cool
Fun Me and my sister also my brother are singers and our studio travels and this game was good and fun vocal practice be for our preferences so thank you
No lag at all what is everyone on  There is no lag, in fact it is possible to get feedback whistle by putting it by the tv so how can there be lag . Than again, i am using 5ghz wifi, ps3 is hardwired to router, and have a octacore cpu on phone.
Help How do I connect the singstar microphone to the ps
Love it didn't have cash for extra mics
