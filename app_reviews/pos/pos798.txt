The Best In Photo Masking Now it needs a 'start with colorphototransparent' backgroundforeground option.
AMAZING
Awesome on my Nexus 6 It seemed difficult at first but after working with it multiple times it's very fascinating  It's a matter of learning techniques to perfect this App.  Take the time to lean it. It's worth it.
It does the job brilliantly on my galaxy Thanks
Used so many times, still working I've used this app for a while, but I still haven't discovered every tool. That's a good thing. There are some bugs, like when you merge an image that you added a filter to, the filter seems to go to the background, and leave the object you were merging. Otherwise, this is one of my favorite apps on my Samsung.
