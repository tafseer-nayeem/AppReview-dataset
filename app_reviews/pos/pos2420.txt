Neat little app Works great except for in airplanes when your phone is in airplane mode.
Works well on S5.  So far vary accurate. ,
More brighter dial skin please I can't even read the number
Very accurate Very accurate on my Galaxy S6. I hope the developer will consider offering theme support,  or at least add a dark theme version.
