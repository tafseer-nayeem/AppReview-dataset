Brilliant but... it takes ages to get passes you get three every 4hrs I recommended the demi lovato path to fame, really good, worth using your passes for it, they are longer stories which is good. By the way, when you start a story on the first episode it's free which is good so then you don't waste the pass if you don't like it.
Awesome game Its one of those games you never get tired of because there's soo many different stories all in 1 app.highly recommended especially for teens..although I do miss when the apo first came out you got to play as much as you want instead of only 3 passes.there should be atleast 5 passes every 3 hours .otherwise overall awesome game
One problem Its the passes I used a code once and its been almost a year since I've played this and it doesn't  let me use another code what's wrong with using more than one please fix this I'll still give 5 stars though DOWNLOAD IT its a good game
Love it But...... This is s awesome game but u have to wait for the tickets for to long. I also have a question about mean girls, at a certain it say I have to pay  20 gems, why can't we continue without paying
I love this app I get to make my own choices and you guys suck for giving away two or three stars anyways so yeah its like the best app I love it so much I can play it all day if I could but you know what I mean if anybody played it so get it and give it 5 stars because it's awesome and legit if you look at the five star rating you see that there at 187 808 find stars oh definitely give it more see ya wouldn't wanna be ya
Wish I could earn more passes and gems for things. Great game even though that was not possible.
Episodes Why is episode not working mi sad because i love episode and it stop working sad   please make it work again
GET THIS Totaly my fave game  You need this. I recommend the storys vampire love match,  ride with me babe and rich witches  But other people complain about the passes I agree that after 8 hours you should have 6 passes but realy...      YOU SOULD NOT BE USING TEC 247
