Not bad It plays well, but impossible to get to Settings once game started. Only way is to force the app to close then reopen to get to main menu. And when game is over you get score but no easy quicktosee number of tricks each side made. MVP on laptop better.
The best bridge app there is The bidding and cardplay skills along with the range of options available easily make this the best bridge app on the market. It is well worth the price but that is not to say that it couldn't be improved. It would be very nice if there was some embedded documentation explaining the bidding systems available in some detail. This version seems to be well behind the iphone version in terms of features and functionality.
Bridge Baron Correction. Bridge Baron is great program on my S5 Android phone. The menu key does work when it is held for a second otherwise it will take you out of the program with a short touch.
Excellent I only play oneplayer, but I love the options to choose best hands and types of deals slam, game or partscore. It's a great way to practice.
Really helpful and fast playing.  When I mess up I can replay the hands until I understand.
Stuartb Excellent but would improve if able to choose some aspects of the convention and know the signals and discards of partner. An overall choice of a basic system not so useful for playing and bidding development
Best time killer on the phone. I spend way too much time on this, but it has improved my social bridge.
Great app Latest lollipop update has messed with display, leaving a number of bids highlighted.
Great game It works well. I would like more information on the conventions used in the game.
Some quirks This is a good app generally. It has a habit of doubling when it ought not and there are times when the result it thinks you should achieve seems impossible. Despite this though I play it a lot and well worth the money.
