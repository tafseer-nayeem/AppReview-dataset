Love it Its fun
Excellent This app was profoundly amazing but mozart was a pure genius watching the notes being played my eyes couldnt keep up
Hero This is perfect to relax to... gonna get a tablet just because of this game
I love all these, although some are I think impossible on a phone I need a tablet too 
Usb midi connection to the real piano feature request Like the originals  full version so much with well known classical. Bought the rest of the series. Disappointed with almost no easy song. I could still refund them but I won't because I want to support the developer.   It would be really nice to hook up with the real piano via midi usb.
