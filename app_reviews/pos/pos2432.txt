this game has not crashed, like most games do after so long. my main problem is that the game is always redownloading to my phone,
Thank You 6 months ago I could not play this game on my Facebook profile. I left a review, and you have fixed this issue now, thank you for letting me play one of my childhood games again after I had nearly given up on it.

Its a great game This game is everythin you'd want, but it is missing one thing, and that is that it should have people walking around.
Life finds a way .... I am a jurassic park fan n I nv stp playin this game . Try changing the spinosaurus roar into the original jurassic park 3 roar .
This is a great game JPB is a awesome game i play it every day. The update us awesome and i don't understand why people are complaing about the update if you don't like it than don't buy the dinosaurs people are stupid just ignore it for god sake.
Still Fun One day I tried to log on and couldn't.  Had to start a whole new park.  The trouble started with not being able to access my Aquatic Park then my game all together.  But, this time around I'm trying not to make the mistakes I wish I hadn't the first time.  For you newbies concentrate on your dinosaur feed caches, because you need to populate your park to make coins.  No real need to spend real  to have fun.
