Awesome game Very addictive and easy to waste time with. Online ranking is great. Game has lots of things to keep it fresh.
Quite entertaining You don't have to put money in to play effectivly. Pretty time consuming, not too redundant. The royalty feature is enticing, but i will never put money into a phone game again.
Great game Ser super lag the last update please fix it i love this game more power god bless
Best game ever Holy crap I really thought this game would be wack but it totally changed my mind. Beautiful graphics and awesome story. Nice level of difficulty and awesome demons
Excellence in gameplay. The story is one that is easy to follow and get Swept Up in... Transporting you to a time ruled by Magic, Myth and Demonic Forces run rampart, but destroying them is all the sweeter.
So far so good Time consuming, but that's what I like. Can get a little laggy but fixes itself after a few seconds. Great game
i like playing it i like the way i play and fight in Dugeons , vut the game lag and half screen keep blinking while open bag showing the town under it
After the pet update The share quest is not working now , I share it on Facebook but it doesn't give the reward . Pls fix this
Fantastic This game is awesome, and free to play lovely game. I enjoy playing it every time
Addictive and nice.. Very much addicted to the game , its very entertaining because of many factions of in game event... i have a request though can you make costumes worth in gold so other players will not spend that much.. thanks love it guys...
New update I've updated my Game and now I can't get into any server it keeps saying it can't load and try every server and it dosent let me in. Please fix asap as I love this game and nearly had 200,000 power so please fix asap
Upgrade Amazing game but how about being able to trade items, money and gems.... Better yet how about a store system that allows you to sell old equipment... I think that would be great, thank you
