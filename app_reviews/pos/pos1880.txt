Streamlined and simplified Finally an app that saves me time instead of encouraging me to waste it. Love this app
Grocery king is great It allows you to organize your lists and it has a pretty extensive database.
I use this app all the time It never fails me. This is the first time I've decided to rate any app. To let people know how great it is. I've been using it for more than 2 years now and I've never had any problems. it keeps me well organized. Great job you guys.
The most comprehensive list I had a problem with this app cause I wasn't paying attention.  Support gently reminded me what to do. The app never stopped working, but my brain did. You can use this app to help with pantry, fridge and freezer inventory, run a  tally on your groceries so you have no surprises when you get to checkout...recipes and store discount cards can be saved here too Do not hesitate If you're looking for a grocery app, THIS IS IT
Great app very handy This is a great app Very easy to use.
Great app Syncs good scans fast just what I wanted Droid razr
Replacing out of milk I used out of milk for several years, even bought the pro version. Then they screwed it up with an update several months ago and never fixed it right. Kind of glad they did, this app is way better in a lot of ways. Always syncs well.
Excellent Don't know what I did without it
Grocery King Truly the king of all shopping list.   I've tried several and this is by far the best one.
Only The best
Great App  I use this app constantly, very impressed.
Easy to use I think this app does everything I got it for and is easy to use.
Helps a lot Thanks
