It is a very good app and it serves my purpose of getting to see my family from long distance, whenever I want to.
Nita's experience Freezes sometimes but I still love it
I like the way you can talk to people and leave messages and video chat to make sure the person that you need to it's a safe and good way to meet singles and to find someone you care about orvac love so I'll give you 5 stars
Great app Love it fast and easy  Quick just like the microwave Lol
I love it No complaints here. My 2 yr old son loves talking to his father when he's unable to visit

Cat I get videos from my daughter on the west side. She sent me a video telling us of her up coming wedding and each one she ask to be something in her wedding it was amazing. I love this technology Even tho she is far away I can now share moments with her and we laugh and cry and laugh again
Love it keeps me in contact with my family and friend around the world
Great for family I really love Glide for sending updates to my family. We all use it as a way to stay in touch and I get to watch my sisters kids playing and growing up
