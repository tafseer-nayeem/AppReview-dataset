One of my favorites. Iconic characters, awesome techniques, and cool branching story lines. Excellent replay value with new game  feature. Would love to see a 3D remake, or sequel. Thanks SE
Yay Chrono Brand new Galaxy S5. Downloaded my favorite game ever, so happy to see it. Works finally following fix. Don't care much for some of the updated graphics, but it's still Chrono Trigger.
The Greatest RPG of All Time And that was just my first pun Seriously though, this is the best RPG ever made, with over 40 different endings depending on whenwhere you beat the game, and it was one of the first RPGs to include a New Game feature. Even if it does require an internet connection, that only drops my rating to 5 instead of the 6 stars this game deserves.
YAY Works beautifully on my Note 4 One of the gems of the early 90's, Chrono Trigger.
