Great app I can't seem to find areas in Centurion, and it doesn't have an offline schedule.
Please include a news or log function. Sometimes the phone freeze and then I've lost your popup. I still want to go into the app and be able to read what the popup said.
Good job Love the torch addition. Very useful app Love the irony of having such a fancy app to help provide information on a basic utility we thought was given in the 21st century.
Finally Accurate info Always up to date, and accurate.
Fab Like this its good to know when its loadshedding
Best one Keeps me informed
Very helpful Best one to use
Load shedding
Ain't no better Way To keep up to date with Eskom's unpredictable loadshedding schedules. 100 accurate for all my saved locations
Extremely helpfull considering the incompetence and lack of foresight of those who govern. Pity the Apartheid Government only planned 20 years ahead. Blame oom Jan.
Looks great But I live in Sydney and the load shedding info is not accurate. I blew the power in my home, and much of my suburb, and there was no warning from your app. If you guys can't predict when I'm gonna stick a screwdriver in the power plug, I may as well delete it.
Great  app I get all the detail as mentioned in this app. Always know when we will be left in the dark
Load shedding The best app. It is always accurate .
