God bless you God will continue to bless you, because you are using this to give the holly  Bible to those who hasn't have it and more easyer to study the word of God. Thank you.
Great but When the app is near the end of a chapter either it ends prematurely not saying the last couple of words or it speaks really fast. Maybe adding a small delay between chapters might help

Bible Audio MP3 Outstanding application for Brazilian Portuguese.  The words are all clearly pronounced.  Thankfully, there is no distracting background music.  For Brazilian Portuguese alone, this application fully deserves FIVE STARS.  L. Naylor, VA
