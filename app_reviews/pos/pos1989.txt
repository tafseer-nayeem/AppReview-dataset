Awesome physics. This game is so awesome. It teaches  the geometry needed, to properly solve the problem.
Love it but The update didn't open any more levels in Treasure Hunt for me     update  it is now working  
Don't know why people complain. Regular FREE extra levels, admittedly had to turn off the bacgrounds for my old galaxy to keep up, but this is the game that keeps on giving.
Lots of fun Great way to pass idle time. Play it all the time.
Rio 2 Love the new level Lots of new animation and you really have to think in order to get your 3 stars or your feathers. Fun like always and I love the new graphics.
