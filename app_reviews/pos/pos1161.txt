Awesome. .. Music is the soul of one's life and SAAVN does a darn good job of bringing it in the palm of our hands...wether it's a family gathering, drive, overnight at friends, a romantic dinner, you name it and with help of music on SAAVN app I have been able to chaar chaand Lagao to my events...great quality, great selection, all you need is great wifi and creativity. .. I just wish they had an option to repeat a song with a shuffle tool.
