Why so many haters It just worked fine for me.. I had a good experience with ola. I booked a cab early this morning and ride came on time. OVERALL SATISFIED
Very good and efficient service most important thing is they are very very punctual and quick in reaching the boarding point.
Software good service worst Software is very good but what is the use Drivers always cancel our request at the last moment. They even ask for extra money or some times operate with personal meters charging more. No way to stop greedy drivers. The support team is a cranky idiotic team which will always tell sorry for the inconvenience caused and we will arrange another cab which will not be available immediately. Worst service by OLA.
Awesome app Loved ola and hated uber The best cab bookingg service is ola. Helpful drivers. Clean cars
Best service Ola you seriously made my life .....with ola store ,ola cabs ,ola cafe and many choices you people are Superrrrrr
Well..I like the app but I selected sedan and still got a mini. Helpful anyway. y
