Ms.  French Spring Cleaning was a FUN hidden object game, never get tired of searching for the same ' Ol thing.  This game changes it up. The coins though.  How do you get rid of them.  I always had way too many.  Specially playing the mini games too
It's a good game...kills a lot time..just don't like how they take points away during searching
SOUNDS FUN READY TO GIVE IT A SHOT
I just love it I love finding objects it makes my brain work search find it its fun
Gives you something to do while waiting. Really good game for me.
Great game Many options to play, nice graphics
Hidden Objects Just all around fun to play while winding down for the evening.
Samsung Galaxy S3 Works on my little phone just great.  I'm on level 25 with over 127 coins that I earned very easily but it was still challenging
