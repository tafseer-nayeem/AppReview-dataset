Love love love Use this when in ER waiting rm or in 2hr line for a ride at Disneyland. Really helps keep everyone interacting with each other rather than keeping their nose in their fbook etc
Loved it My bigger sister installed this and she's very happy about it. So I thought I would give it a try. Now I know how awesome this game truly is.
