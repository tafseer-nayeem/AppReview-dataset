good good
Very disappointed bought it and it want restore what I bought
Loved it We bought the game Very affordable and my toddler never gets bored digging PLEASE ADD MORE DINOS  Only thing I don't like is you can't do full screen... My tablet home icons show at bottom and when he clicks his tiny thumb hits home buttons ALOT... That's a huge pain but other than that he loves it and likes that he finds so many different things
Digging for dino bones My grandson who is three must loves this game.
Good game, kinda tricky ads. My kiddo loves the game. But I do kind of have to stand over him to make sure he click any of the slightly tricky ads. Still overall five stars. Devs did good job. Thanks.
