Great game Not usually a fan of this genre but this game is fantastic.  I find the strategy deep, yet accessible.  I highly recommend this game.  1 to Gameloft
This game is awesome, but... I never thought I would have this problem, but it won't let me pay for any gems anymore. It keeps saying error 11. I don't know what that means
Outstanding  Addictive Best strategy game so far to me. If there's anyone experiencing crashes, it's because the phone doesn't compatible with the game's requirements and poor network connection is the problem also.
Could be better. It would be nice to be able to battle your Facebook friends. Also the cargo ship is kind of lame I thought it'd be a better gifting experience. I purchased a expensive GEM pack. Only to find out that I only gifted 1 gem to to my one guild member. I was trying to give him half of the gems that I purchased. Fail.
Great The game is fun ,I don't have any. Complaints the system is working perfectly I love it I will sure recommend it to my friends
