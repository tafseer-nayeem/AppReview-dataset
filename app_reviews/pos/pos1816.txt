Get ready for it This app does nothing but consume your time and you will get anything done if you banter and take everyone's chirping seriously. If not, you could probably get recommendation on food and recipes or funny cat photos videos and awesome content curated by bunch of people on a single account. And don't get too offended when someone says Hi to you. Its an open space dear, embrace it.
Has the potential. ...to be the best social media app available. But its not perfect
