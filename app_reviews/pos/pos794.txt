No issues Have LGMS345, and thus far only positive results.  Highly adjustable, and excellent compliment to the Camera app.  To those users with doubts, try before you buy.
Fantastic Eliminates 4k 5 min limit Gotta say you've done a heck of a job with this app Flavio And super responsive support as well I've got it running on 3 Samsung's and it's awesome on all 3 Galaxy Note 3, Note Edge  S6 Edge Not perfect, but for an app this ambitious, I'm not unrealistic and expect it to be flawless But it's done some great work already and I've been using it almost every day. Will start recommending it to my audience.
Manual focus is KILLER on the LG G4 VERY cool. Unmatched video recording app, perfect companion to Camera FV5. Only suggestion is the possible addition of customizable preset combinations to toggle between.
Best Bluetooth Video Recorder Now you can record your smartphone video using your bluetooth sound
This app is awesome It's a must have I use this on a daily basis, I had one question, is it possible to make a line in setting I'm a musician and if I could run the line out and plug it in to the headphone jack as a line in it would help me and I'm sure other people if they were to have this option Thanks So Much Guys
