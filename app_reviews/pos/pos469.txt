Love it used to hate it on android but after many improvements done... I just simply LOVE IT Just hope more sound fx will be added for android.
Loved it Its fun because u get to sing and I LOVE singing its my favorite thing to do but its kinda lagging a little bit Fix it plz 
Loved it This app is soo amazing I can sing all my favorite song on it and it helps me be a better singer
Better Update this app is pretty awesome,  there are trolls as with any social media but I have met some pretty great people I give it 5 stars at the moment, I wish that it would save if you needed to come back and sing so you wouldn't have to start all over
Fantastic but It will not give me my credits when I do it 3 times it only gives me 5 
Addictive I absolutely love this app. I love this so much I pay the 4.99 a month. The song choices are amazing and the friends you make is awsome
Offline Version I loke this game, but i hope you nake the offline version.... Please.... and please make the credit not too expensive....
Karon Carpenter This is  an amazing app try  it out you don't need to buy anything.
