It is definitely a fun game even though the wheel is RIGGED. It is, it is not an assumption. It is a fact. You can check it with a simple randbetween function in excel. I tested it for 2 hours and got a 40  less 1000 results than you would get spinning the wheel. It is obvious that they have prioritized the outcome. However, if they haven't done so everyone would be at the end gme in no time and there would be nothing to do.

This game is awesome Actually I don't think I have played a game like this before it is different in a good way of course but I really want to say something about the defend why can't be there a storage when I can store the other defends  It is really depressing to see my defends get dumbd in the ocean It would be really cool if you increase the amount of gold earned by the wheel too other than that the game is cool
Great Simple fun and time consuming perfect
