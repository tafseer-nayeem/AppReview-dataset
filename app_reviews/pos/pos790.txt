I love it Saves me unwanted hair changes and thousands spent unnecessarily  i can pick colour here and show it to my hairdresser, simple as that 
1010 I did buy the premium, but even if you didn't get that, you have colors yo choose from. The premium just adds custom colors. I love it It really helps me decide on New hair colors Love it
It is the most popular... Game ever, it is nice and wonderful
Realistic Gives me realistic possible hair colours that I can choose from if I decide to dye my hair 
Awesome Takes a min to learn how to fine tune your colors, but once you get it down, it is an awesome simulation to help you decide if you want to go with that color. I do have the upgrade and has worked well for me.
Hair Change Needed a new style.
