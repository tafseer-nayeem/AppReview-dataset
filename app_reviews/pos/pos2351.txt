Makes droid better Great app, customer service is top notch with prompt feedback. Makes droid easier to use. Samsung Note 4 on ATT
Natural operation Should be built in to Android. Reading apps should never rotate, movie playback always horizontal. Then some need to go back and forth.  Glas to have this evening when I have pay.
Exactly what I wanted. Set each app individually to be locked to always portraitlandscape or leave to system setting. So I can make sure I don't go landscape midtext message, but my videos always start landscape, pictures portrait, other apps set to change as normal. You can lock to PortraitLandscape Up or Down only, or still leave that to the accelerometer Just missing a batch option  I'd lock everything to  portrait then change a few apps back, by exception.
What I need. It is here This is what I 'm looking4. It is good vs 0.99 paid
Works as described on the Moto X 2013 with 5.1.
It's perfect.  It seems like there is always an app that turns the wrong way just as you are about to use it, then, it seems like it takes a decade for it to rotate back. This eliminates that completely.
Convenient Utility Works as described.
Great app very useful
M.m. Nice app now when i go to make a call my phone will not flip side ways and mess my dialing up.thank you.
Solves one of the most annoying issues I had with my phone. Totally worth the price.
Excellent
Useful, great app Well designed app, intuitive and really useful. Better than relying on the native screen rotation. Simple to customize
Have been looking for a good screen orientation manager for a while. I hate my phone's autorotation feature and it is so annoying to always switch the screen lock. This finally fixes all of that. Just set it once and you're in complete control of your phone's screen for every app Definitely a musthave utility
Works Convenient little app. Does what it's supposed to.
