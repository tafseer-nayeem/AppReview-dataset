Would Be Great If I Could Play It. Every Time When I Start The An Error Happens I Just Get Stuck On The So Bye Bye.     Rest In Perperronies Train Sim
Excellent and realistic This game takes the modern railway world and turns it into a lifelike and detailed simulator. Suggestions include adding track switchingpoints and including British and American settings.
Perfect Its realistic train game days and nights r also realistic as compared to train sim ur the best D
Please increase top speed of trains. After latest update we are having TGV like trains. Atleast make top speed to 300 kmph.
Great, but won't work with Android 5 Lollipop Previously tried to run this on Lollipop but wouldn't get beyond loading page.However on a preupdate device this is brilliant, graphics are very good especially at night.Could do with more train variations for a beginner.But it's so much better than those boring Metro things.Please sort out the update problem though.
I love the makers of this game thankyou you must download this game now OK download now I always play this In my free time best train game in the world there is not a better game than this DOWNLOAD NOW 
Nice game.when will be the next update available.what about release of Indian train simulator.
Love it but Sometimes emergency  brakes dont work the button for the brakes need to be made bigger
Plzz provide a simulator for Indian railway .plzz its my humble request to developers
Loved it The way i loved it is that the brake is quiet and the brake when i pull it to 100 it does not brake slowly it does it super fast inded and when im braking to a staition it might be tricky to stop at last staiton if your looking upwards you will not see the bottom it will atchuly crash to you buffer lol the end
