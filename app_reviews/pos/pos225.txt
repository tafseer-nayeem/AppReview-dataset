Awesome This is my go to app whenever I need tickets. I love it Cheap and easy to buy.
Love it Ive been able to go to the games for the just over the price of a movie at the theater Very good find would recommend 1010 LET'S GO HEAT
Best apps This app is the best I have had no problem since I got it, cheap tickets though.
Love the app I've been using this app for a while to buy all my tickets. Have had no problems at all. Works like a charm
It works now I still wish it had minor league sports but is still a great app purchased a lot of reds tickets from the app and Bengal tickets are to high
I was a little bit skeptical about this app but I tried and everything went well Highly recommend If you want to get 10 just singing up, use the code GUSTAVO30 and both of us will get 10 free. Thanks
Was hesitant to try at first but after doing some research and trying the app, had a great experience. Really happy I gave it a try. it was very simple to navigate the app and I was texted with updates in regards to my tickets. Had a great time, and it was really convenient to use. Keep up the great work
The cheapest tickets prices for sports events I love this app never print out tickets just scan your ticket by phone, never has fees and taxes not like ticket master always charging you 20.00 fee but not gametime app , always very cheap to by sports tickets
So far so good If you would like to receive a 10 credit, use code KELLY53
PROBLEM I try to add a promo code like IPK OR IPKC AND DOESNT WORK BUT OVER ALL ITS A GOOD APP
Love it It's great my mom just got tickets to the game on Wednesday sixer vs raptors
