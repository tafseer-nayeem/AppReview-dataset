Works well with my Colorado haven't had any issues, definitely recommend it
Works great in Holden Colrado  Trax This app works very well with my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Love that i can google search an address directly in the BringGo app. Occasionally will not load immediately from vehicle interface but restarting the phone clears it just like having to reboot your pc.
Brilliant Bringo navigation is great in my bew Colorado. Couldn't be happier.
LTZ Colorado 7 Super stuff, but............
Simple Easy to use as it works great with my Colorado and it not that pricey
Owner driver Its an awesome system
