Deejay killa Loved it
Best app Works perfectly on my note 4 thou just 1 thing to consider adding, when you activate the atomic feature the fx and eq are no longer available.
Soundcloud error solution For those who can't connect to soundcloud i have a quick fix for you here, simply delete soundcloud from your phone and attempt to connect to it on the edjing app, enjoy.
Fixed. Its back working now, I think it was that i had usb debugging on. Thanks for the promt response. Love this app.  
I love it but However The app is awesome I love it everything works perfectly. However I would love it more if we can get more for less.
