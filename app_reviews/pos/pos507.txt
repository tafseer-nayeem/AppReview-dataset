Best customer service ever exprnced Though my wishes are nt fulfilled due to some technical problems they have great commitment to help their customers...
Always prefer amazon over others Great offers great support and one more imp thing about amazon is it full filled promises. Only searching has to be improved that is one point missing over others.
Loved it After reading all the reviews here i was a lil worried that should i buy stuffs from here or not So i thought to give it a chance and really Amazon amazed me Costs are within budget and delivery time was quick, I received my package within 3 days and with no extra delivery charges. Better than Flipkart for some things and but yeah i didn't find that huge amount of collection to choose as you guys promised. So please work on that. Besides this thumps up from me
greatest shopping ever love you amazon Regarding the service no one even come close to the amazon delivery is very fast, products are genuine i can shop by closing my eyes , return policy is great this is one and only one side that allows you if you don't like product you can simply return even product is not damaged , deals are great, prices are very genuine there is no hidden cost , only issue regarding the amazon is sorting of products please make it simple. Finally love amazon
Best shopping experience I have tried flipkart, snapdeal and Amazon. Found amazon best out of them. Though the app needs some UI changes. Maybe material design for android But their service is by far the best.
Genuine buying site app Very much satisfied with the deals on the site and the product received are in very good condition.
