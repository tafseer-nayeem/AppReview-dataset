All the cry babies need to shut it Its not that bad its got the same feel as skip bo its taken some getting used to but I'm not going to hate on the game at all i love phase 10 and will continue to play it
Like the new update Not sure what everyone is gripping about I really like the new pro version glad to have the landscape view and could care less what the avatars look like runs great on my phone no lag at all great update in my opinion. Everyone is gripping about the landscape layout but pretty much every game I have from Google Store requires that everyone is allowed there own opinion but like I said I love the new update.
