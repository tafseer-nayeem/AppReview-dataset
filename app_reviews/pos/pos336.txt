Eric Bledsoe is OP This dude stats all 8s and 9s .... That's better dwade, kobe and lebron.....wtf....Also lebron or Steph curry are not in starting line up...fix that...John wall is pathetic...Update roster
Brings me back to my childhood This game is still as sick as it was back in the mid 90s. Controls can occasionally be a little iffy but they're usually pretty spot on. I love it.
Amazing The game is great to play but the most frustrating part is when you can't block bigger players and please add new legends like jordan and throwback lebron and kobe
classic Oh the memories if you a 80's or early 90's baby than you remember this classic arcade game. Love how they brought back the original commentator
Translates well to mobile The game controls are simplified and easy to pick up for mobile play. I'm looking forward to the next roster update.  Samsung Note 4 User
