I got what I expected when I bought it. I only wanted the map but the trait tracker is really useful too. Would be better if you could have a select all onoff button on the interactive map legend.
Fantastic app Simple, quick and responsive. Almost everything i needed in this app. Interactive map is amazing, minus the hint of which skyshard, when clicked on. I hope they add the delves and dungeons maps as well.
Totally worth the few pence just for the interactive map... tells you the location of EVERYTHING Awesome.
Great app Keeps you up to date with your traits and the interactive map is awesome. This app makes an already great game even better
Only thjng I would recommend is seeing a check list to be able to mark whay shards you have gotten but other then that fantastic
Perfect ESO Companion Absolutly perfect for keeping track off my reasearch, but you put Equalets instead off Epaulets  definitly worth the price
