Overall this app is great If I'm busy at one meet I can still check times on live results to see a different meet. Easy app to use. Kids enjoy checking for patches after each meet it is fun for them to do. Biggest downside is that if the app is active for to long it will crash. Have to exit out and restart, then search for your meet all over again. I always recommend families getting this app. IMX tool is great also
I loved everything But I wish it had a feature where you could check what meet you where signed up for and maybe a check list on what to prepare for the meet
Great app. I never misplace it. Reminds me when to get stuff done.
The results and goals features are great SWIM FOR LIFE
Definitely useful This is a very necessary application for all competitive swimmers
Deck Pass plus This is great for keeping up with my grandson's times. I wasn't able to attend their meet due to work,  but I was able to track his progress. Much better than meet mobile.
I'm a swimmer, ... I'm a swimmer, and i can find all of my times.
I am on there daily Good app
Cool This app was amazing. Loved it
