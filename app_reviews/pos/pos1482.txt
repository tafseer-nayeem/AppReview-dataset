Works Great I'm able to to watch just about anything on the go. Within the past year there were only two times that TV2GO was not able to play due to technical difficulties. Other then that it works great.
Love it but... I love the app as it is very convenient, user friendly and great navigation speed however vh1 is not an option. ..but why
Significant improvement over prior versions, works well on all my electronic portals. You cannot go wrong with using this app. No more lockups or chattering is the major advance.
Great CAN WATCH CABLE CHANNELS ON MOBILE DEVICE However you cannot watch Network shows ABC, NBC etc.An excellent app very few buffering problems.  I too, would like to see native Chromecast support for my HDTV.
Thanks to the in laws We use the in laws xfinity EVERYDAY The kids get a kick out of it Car rides, cartoons, movies ect... Works on phones, tablet  laptops no issues
Great app One of my favorite apps works well. One of xfinity's better successes. Has occasionally glitched but I use it as much as my TV. Adding aditional commercial breaks after stopping or going to another screen on network stations is very annoying as is repeating the same commercial.  I use this app everyday and works well on my tablet when I am tethered to my phone.
Pleasantly surprised This app is so easy to use and the playback quality is great. Sure, there are commercials just like you would have while watching live TV. Good news is that you can skip some of them. Great app to be able to  watch ypur favorite movies and shows from just about anywhere. Now if only I can put it down and go to sleep...haha.
