Great game,  minor flaw for some users If the ability to make keys mappable would be added that would be great, the games not quite playable on my controller device because it's key mapping is different,  otherwise great game.
Great graphics great fun Not too stressful, beautiful graphics, plenty of nostalgia. The perfect sequel for the old game.
Brilliant game just like the classic The game and controls feel just like the very early and first prince of persia. The playability is very good unlike many other good looking but bad playing mobile games. The only thing I wish is it had a little more of is the Persian music. Apart from that it is 9 out of 10. For those who remember it was the music that made the pop games good.
A Gaming Revelation This is what we've all come to love and enjoy about Prince of Persia and its all in the palms of your hands in this perfect 3D side scroller if you love Trine 2 then you'll love this Prince of Persia. Much love to Android and the mobile world around the world for giving an ole' gaming hound a new gaming bone to naw on To my wife BABY I love you with all my HEART love always your DONNIE.
Great, but... Please please please add native controller support. You can control movement already, but you cant walk, jump, attack, etc. UPDATE You listened Works perfectly with bluetooth controller. Worth every penny. Thanks.
Great fun game Lots of fun to play. I highly recommend it  You definitely don't need the in app purchases to finish the game  only if you're an achievement hunter.
great game great adventure. reminds me of old pop sf. it was fun finding all treasures and beating achievements.
