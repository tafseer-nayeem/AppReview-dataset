Great Game It is a great game. But the energy regenration for booty cave is too long. For elite instances, it cant be sure that you will get at least 1 blood stone drop out of 3 challenges. Hope it will get better at the next update
Heroes charge Love the original but HD had 2 many bugs 4 my phone keeped crashing. Now have lost my 90lvl account with VIP 14 had 2 start over again in original haven't heard back from tec team n didn't keep a record of my account ID
Great great game guys, but the new layouts almost killing it, I can see using that layout for tablets maybe but not us phone users, either way though its not stopping me from playing haha
