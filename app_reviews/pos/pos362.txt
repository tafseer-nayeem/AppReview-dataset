Good one
Usefull app Its a good app...it really makes ur brain run when you fell ur brain dead. Personally it helps  Well done 
Still awesome.. Seems to be organized better, and runs more smoothly now, my one complaint is that the overall evaluation has been removed.
Amazing Super fun, especially since it's customized for me. Love it.
Great for mental fitness and... I also noticed it helps with stress tolerance and emotional resilience. I found I do best with all of this with 30, not 10, minutes a day, but this is a bit cumbersome to do so I am trying 10 after a long hiatus.
Needs to be cheaper in price. This app is great but not worth the asking price.
Lumosity being the only other brain trainer I can compare it to,  it's my opinion that this one is superior in every way. Initially there are more games available,  the cost for unlocking others is vastly cheaper, and the games themselves truly feel like a challenge as they scale to your experience. Would rate higher if I could
Great app I'm smarter than i thought. This is an awesome app. I actually feel like this Gane had purpose not just to pass time.
If the tips that are being shown in the game are facts then humans are doomed.. Play this game and keep ur brain alive..
