Awesome Game supercell Arguably one of the best strategy games on the Google play store.  I am ADDICTED to this game,  and you will be too within a matter of minutes.  
Best game ever I have no bad things too say for this owesom game, only suggestion maybe besade gunboat to introduce aircraft carrier with airforce. That will be complete war game experience. Best wishes and ceap the good work.
SUPERCELL Hatsoff to supercell awsm games awsm u all lv u all thx fr introducing such strategy games to us playing games frm 4 years clash of boom day...luv u all muahhhh
Updated review Was brilliant addictive fab, has now become slow and boring. Upgrades take forever and collection of resources for upgrades takes an eternity to do. That was April now it's November. After I got passed the tipping point level 16 xp game has progessed brilliantly. 1  has become 5 
Fun Game This has its quirks but it's fun to challenge yourself to defeat others. You win and loose to develop your small army. I like this game very much. It forces you to spend diamonds or financial resources to grow. There are some players who purchase extra diamonds to grow their bases. However it's great to earn and develop your bases through victories.
Pretty Sweet Game I Love it. Great past time. Join My Task Force, PHXBOMBNUGZS. Let's Destroy N get Money Together.
Love  Hate... NEVER spent money on a game before this one I did here, just a little, and don't regret it. So no real hate... You don't need to spend, but if you get impatient and want to buy some diamonds to speed things along... Great game, I've been sort of obsessed with it. I have it running on a WiFi only tablet, so I eagerly await having a connection so I can buildupgradeattack etc.  Just getting started with a Task Force which brings a whole new perspective to the game.
Best game ever IF U LIKE CLASH OF CLANS THEN I GUESS U SHOULD GET BOOM BEACH AND HAY DAY THEY ARE BOTH EXACTLY LIKE CLASH OF CLANS IN MY OPINION IT IS BETTER THAN CLASH OF CLANS.
Balanced gameplay A lot of these games push you to buy things right away, but this is actually playable without buying into it. That being said, I'd much rather pay for the game in the first place and be able to play entirely for free and equally with everyone else afterwards. That's life with ftp games.
Great game but Wish you can up grade more than one thing at a time pez can you do that
CRAZY ADDICTING U guys should add more statues like speed boost to speed your troopsdefense up and then to slow down attackers troopsdefense. OH AND ALSO I'M NOT GETTING THE CO OPERATOR ACHIEVEMENT IT JUST SITS AT THE SAME NUMBER AFTER EVERY OP CAN U PLEASE FIX...
