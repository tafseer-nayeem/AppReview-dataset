Home run Baby This game has improved since the last time I played on a different phone.. I have Jose Bautista from the Blue Jays, good job. Update, since the last review I had to restart everything, due to a factory reset. Not overly worried, the access to the store is still nonexistent. Can't have everything 
Pretty good Works well on my Note 4.  Some lag when fireworks go off. In multiplayer sometimes the home runs don't register or have a delay. Looks like the problem with NPC players in single player derby hitting 20 home runs is fixed. Still some minor issues but I'm enjoying the game.
.... I'm currently stuck at 784 ft. In Derby mode...and I'm also currently stuck at 798 ft. In Arcade mode...can anyone tell me how to hit 800 ft. Or better.. It would be greatly appreciated..
Hits the sweet spot So far it's fun though I can see that earning better hitters, equipments, boosts, etc., will be expensive and take a long time to earn. We'll see if the fun lasts long enough to actually earn a decent reward.
Home run derby Great graphics and awesome game alot fun  and time consuming
It's the home run derby the pitcher is supposed too throw the ball where i want.  Anytime you get on a good streak the pitcher goes into bad ball mode. Please fix
Excellent game Very well done  Perfect blend of playable and toughness Definitely a keeper Download NOW,  Or you stink

Looks like a great game can't wait to play it. this app didn't work for me it never hits the ball.
Great game A great update for the app would be legends Ruth, Mantle Ted Williams etc and give more money because it takes so looooong to get another player
