My favorite game app. So addictive. Just can't earn a lot of coins. Don't really like purchasing them.
Lots of fun Nice job on the App Sorry that so many people give this App a bad rating because you charge a little money for some things... when they should be rating the functionality of the App. They gripe when free apps have ads then gripe about a dollar or two to have an App without ads  pitiful I tell you  Keep up the great work
I just really like this game. I like the questions, the nerve wrecking music, for lack of a better word that keeps you with an uncomfortable sense of urgency. It's like you can hear an imaginary host saying, You must make a selection...time is running out. You must choose.  And all the while you're watching the clock count down, and along with it goes your makebelieve potential fortune. And when you get the answer correct  It's bells and whistles all the way  Riveting Outstanding  5 Stars
Educating This game really challenges your smartness. It also educates you in things you didn't know. Love this game.
Great game I wasn't a fan but I saw my girl playing it and is actually really great
Love that you keep playing even after you get the question wrong. Most apps will basically say oh sorry you lost after the first question you miss. And I do enjoy the upgrade of this app.
Game is super fun Love the game its fun just 1 thing I wish coins were unlimited tho
Very fun and challenging,  does need better instructions on how to start the game, but once I  figured it out I am having fun
