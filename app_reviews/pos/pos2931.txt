I loved it because it has cute little clothes and the dog ilove puggggggggggsssss 
Amazing It does cost money but my daughter loves it
Love it I love this game but I think it costs too much money for what its worth.I probably wouldn't call this game too addicting because after a while you start to get bord of it,I'm not saying for life but for the day.I am 9 years old and I like this game but my little brother who is 5 years old would like but not as much as me.I would say the age limits of this game is 7.
Great game for 2 yr olds Easy for them to figure out, fun
i  like  but  this  game  is  very  very  bets
Amazing It's really cool because you get to care for really cute animals.
