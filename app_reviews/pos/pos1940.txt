Fun Little Horror Room Escape Puzzle Game Played on a Galaxy Note 4 running 5.0.1 works with S Pen. Has 18,000 Google Play Achievement XP points. Well Put together and keeps you engaged. Wish it was longer, but adequate for the 0.99 price tag. Took me just over 3 hours to complete all puzzles without any outside help on first play through, may take alot longer if you're not a really good puzzle solver. Definitely want to use earbuds to get the full effect of the soundtrack and FX.
Too short I loved it but it's kind of short 
Bought this game yesterday. I wasn't disappointed
