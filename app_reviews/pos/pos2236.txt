I really like this game. The only problem I have the moment is the amount of dice that u get on a daily basis isn't enough to play very many games. The more levels u complete, the more dice u need,  it just doesn't even out. 24hrs is too long to wait on a refill.
So much fun This is the best bingo game in Google play in my opinion. It's not like any other bingo game I've ever played. I'm definitely addicted to this game
Love it but spend a lot of money. I love this game and play all the time.  It never lags for me and downloads right away. It hasn't stopped in the middle of a game either. The only thing wrong is you need to pay a lot of money to play a bunch. If you don't pay for extra money or gems, you  only get to play a couple of games. Wish you got to play more without having to pay.
Lovin it Only problems with the game is that you need to award more dice for placing 1st, 2nd, and 3rd  place
