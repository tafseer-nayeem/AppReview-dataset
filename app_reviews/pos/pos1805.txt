Wow  this is awesome I'm impressed, the latest update has really upped the game. Smooth, intuitive, looks great and is very engaging and actually fun to use It's clear that you've put a lot of thought into all the different areas and how they work together as a whole. Great work devs
From 1 star experience to 5 star experience I rarely rate or review an app but you just made me do it. Well done app team, im lovin it The only suggestion is make an option to rate the app because not everyone would go through the hassle of exit linkedin gt open play store gt find linkedin gt review. For my case, it's worst because after writing this long review, it got timed up. So here i am writing the 2nd one but your app team deserve this. Love it
Thank God Someone has taken me out of tgat junk app. I would never expect linkedin to have such a nice app. I appriciate the designer and the developer who did such a nice app. 5 stars obviously
Vast Improvement Much better, now I actually want to use the app...
Finally loving the mobile version It finally has mostall the functionality I use on the desktop.
