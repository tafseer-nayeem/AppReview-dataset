Best Craps game on android period. The best craps game period could it use a few tweets yes, but nothing else come close to this has far as being the most  realistic, they earned my vote and five stars
Only good Craps game I've found on Android, worth the 2 bucks. I like the voices and the customization options.
Best craps app and developers Solid program Thanks for the lay bets and buys. Also glad to see that you can tap the puck to turn on place bets and come odds. To the people that think there are too many SEVENS, deal the game awhile and you'll see your fair share of point 7, point 7, 7, yo, 7, point 7
Gets you ready First of all, let me say thank you for making such a great app. I had no idea how to play craps before your app and gladly bought the full version as you deserve to be rewarded for your efforts. Very well done
Works great This is not only by far the best craps app. Its also one of my best apps of all the apps I use.
