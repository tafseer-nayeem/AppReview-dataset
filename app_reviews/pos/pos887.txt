was it a bug its works just fine with the older ver. everytime i try loggin using another fb account, i got randomly logged out after a couple of minutes, repeatedly.. cookies is available, which is saved me from rewriting my email and pass login..
Love it Although download speed is litle bit slow, but stil i love it.
Awesome App I love it, works great, it's fast. This is the best browser app in the Play Store.
Better than previous opera but...... Need settings in which my saved pages will be synchronized
Best app in this word I love this app very much in my life. It's speed is amazing. 
No pop up ads. Probably the only browser on the market that doesn't get attacked by ads. 55
I loved it very much.... I suggest you people to download and use this app...
Add folder option in saved pages To organize previous saved pages more efficiently.
Awesome app Will be great if you add a feature for setting number of download at a time and  create a seperate service for downloads,in low memory phones the app itself closes when minimized..all the best for your future work devs..
Sony Xperia e4g Works perfectly on my new phone
Kekaaaaaa Its the best browser we have ever seen
Lag during startup There is a bit lag when the app starts... please fix that
I LOVE IT Amazingly great
Opera mini It is good browser to open link
