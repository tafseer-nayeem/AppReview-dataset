Great time to pass the time away. I wish u have unlimited turns for those who can't play as fast as others. I do not like when I'm stuck on a level, then u have 2 buy more to continue. That's  no fun. The games are free, but to go on, u have to buy. I still like the game. 5 stars.
Great game. I can't stop playing it.  
Great Entertaining and fun. Love it.
Better Than Candy Crush I love this game It doesn't cheat me like that other crap game.
Very Bad I Use Too Much Data From My Verizon Mobile And I Payed 187.99 For My Data
Refreshingly different Unlike every other game of this type, it breaks from the redundant and provides challenges by mixing it up.
