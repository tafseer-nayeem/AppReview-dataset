SURFING NEWS AND CONTEST LIVE
WSL APP GREAT GOOD QUALITY LIVE STREAMING
Nice looking app.
Very good 
Good app Nice
Great app Love the chromecast support,  works great  gave 5 stars, the app looks great
Only down side is when watching the live stream comps when the Samsung phone advert comes on it freezes the app and causes havoc with my phone to , it happens at exactly the same frame of the advert , to the point when it starts I close the app and restart when I think it's finished. Otherwise love it
Snappy, handy and great features Biggest bonus is Chromecast support, a tad buggy sometimes in weird scenarios but gives you everything you need to follow the WSL events with high quality coverage throughout the year.
Finally, Chromecast support Thanks for listening, 5 stars.
Fantastic app One of the best apps i ever used Very nice material design and the live stream player awesome. Really nothing to point out except occasional returning to portrait while in landscape
Excellent App Well laid out, stable, AllShareChromecast capable.... All around very good app. Be nice if there were an option to comment.
