I have been amazed with NEXT 3D What happened NEXT 3D went from great to it won't even launch. NEXT 3D Lite will though. Got any help.
Still the best launcher . After all this time of being released this launcher is still one of the best The amount of things it can do is amazing  Updates never fail.
The best I tried all of them out there and this is the best of them all , its smart and easy to use. I just love it 
Version 3.7.3 Paid VERSION ADS Needs Internet To Run A Launcher If The Adds Aren't Removed , I'm Gonna Find Me Another Launcher To Use..  And Trust Me There Are Better Launchers When Opening Screen After Timeout, It Brings Me To Random Online Screen Pages.. This Launcher Should Not Need Internet To Run All The Time, Then When Opening Screen I would Have To Keep Setting Next Launcher As Default Without Internet Connection,  Unless There's An Update Somewhere or New Themes, Please Fix
Glad I didn't get around to getting a refund. The updates have obviously done a tremendous job at making this launcher one of the best. I was browsing my purchased apps when I realized I never followed through with the refund. I just did a factory reset on my phone so I figured I'd give it another shot. I loved the look and idea back then...but now it runs flawlessly.
Constant crash Was a 5 star, since the software update. My Note2 has been constantly crashingfreezing.
Well worth the price. I have been using it for a couple of years so far and it is very worth it considering how much I use it.
Excellent Many customizations make it so you don't get bored with it.
