Amazing My 15 month old son loves this app We originally had the free version but upgraded because he kept clicking the ads. Now no more ads  he's entertained for quite some time Love, love, love this app
Bravo Lots of colour, smooth transitions and realistic sounds. Makes for a fun and educating app
