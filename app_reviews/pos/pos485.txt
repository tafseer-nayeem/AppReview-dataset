I like it. I am a veteran and enjoy reading an honest, unbiased journalism that actually asks questions vs. the publishing of White House statements followed by interviews with people who just reiterate the published statement.
Stars  Stripes Next to the Navy Times this has always been my 2nd best Military news.
Military Life I enjoy this app. because I have read this paper for years.
A must have source for any military buff. This application is amazing to stay in tune with the military. CNN is complete garbage about anything militarily, so this is only source I trust.
