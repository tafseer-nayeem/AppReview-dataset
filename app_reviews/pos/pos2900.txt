Happy child I have been looking for an incy wincy spider game for my 2 year old for ages.... This one is the only proper game I can find One very happy 2 year old
Excellext My kids love this game.  Have it installed on several different phones and tablets.  Have not had a single problem.

First installed this app on my iphone a couple years ago for my grandson.  He loved it . Now his sister enjoys it on my android. Worth the money

My son loves it My 20 month old son loves it. Works great on the new Google Galaxy Nexus 7 tablet. He even learned to drag and drop after one day of playing. My only issue is that he keeps accidentally hitting the music button and can't get back out. Wish you had more apps for Android.
Toddler loves it This ap has lots of simple interactive features that are easy for a toddler tapping on objects mostly. My daughter loves touching everything to see what it does. She especially likes the little fly that tells you facts about rain and caterpillars and other things. She now tells me that when a cloud gets full of water it rains. She can play with it for hours. Love it.
More for adroid I have both this app and the bus one. We love then please provide more
Best app for baby  This is my ten month olds absolute favorite activity
