Awsome thanks for the update. Love it. But I see people complaining about having to pay to upgrade again after downgrading and closing out the game. This happened to me too.  But I'm guessing it's a bug. I'm sure this will be fixed soon. And the people dissing the downgrade option must have not played the game enough or don't understand how it works. You can now specifically tune a vehicle for a certain track. Keep up the good work guys. Been playing this since it first came out.
Great update being able to downgrade, don't like that you have to repurchase the upgrades if you exit the game though.
Best waste of time This game is the bees knees.
Fun so far. Seems like a fun game so far. Had to get a new phone and lost all my progress. Real bummer on that.
Love this game Just wish there was more of it.
The new upgrade is annoying... there should be a choice for having the new update. However, I like the new car and that the ads dont jam anymore. Still a great game, but it was still a little more awesome before the new update.
Love it New update is great hot rod is so cool
Love the new world Love the new world
