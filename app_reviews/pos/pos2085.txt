wreck the Blek Really a good game app, would recommend for hand to eye convocation, geometry memory, and a killer of time to proceed to next level.  Very challenging so far, LYM631
Great, but achievements don't work at all edit 9.15.15 achievements are fixed
Original and fun. Thank you for adding S Pen compatibility D Gameplay is enjoyable and levels are rather well designed. Edit I forgot that I had this game, but this update had me playing it again. Thanks a lot
Words can't describe how great this is. Great game for thinking outside of the box, keep up the great work and if you can make more levels
Engaging Starts off simple. Regularly introduces new elements in gameplay to keep things interestingchallenging.
Great game So simple yet surprisingly challenging once you get to the higher levels
So much fun This game is super addicting and really fun. Challenges you to think outside the box in crazy ways. Definitely worth the cost
Amazing Watch the video it shows you how the game is meant to be played. Amazing game and I will definitely be playing this. Lots of replay ability. Many solutions to every problem. My phone isn't even that great and it works perfectly.
Love this game This game is very professionally made, it's put together well with a relaxing feeling to it. It offers a steady difficulty curve and is very addicting l. Well worth the 1 that its on sale for.
Best game ever I love this game How many levels are there I am stuck on level 23. My sister is stuck on level 0. I would get the game right away if I were you. Is there multiplayer mode
