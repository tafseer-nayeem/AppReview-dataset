Ready to delete Update Awesome 2nd update great job           UPDATE... YOU HAVE BEEN.. DELETED..........                          OLD...If you want me to spend money on this game u have to increase our winning percentage. It has horrible pay outs No daily bonus and horrible hourly bonus
I really like the game but it takes too long to get enough coins for me to play.  450 is the minimum amount I can play when I am only receiving 400, 700, or 900 often, other times 1000.
Fast, fun, great graphics. I love this game, I love the quick hits. It's hard to stop when you start losing and you limit the loss you're willing to lose.  I only use the free coins you get or win.
Quick games Most of the games are fun and entertaining. It helps me pass the time. I love it
Good Games Games are not good on payouts or bonus rewards ,however this needs to be fixed quickly just saying the Games are good .
Great past time Could use more coins on bonus spins should start with 10,000 to 100,000
Tammy The points on this game sucks. I love the game but I only get to spin what maybe three times. Seriously you should give more points to play with. It's bad enough you don't give decent points out but when I buy them, they disappear if I stop and come back to play later. They disappear..... I don't think I will. Be ordering anymore. Not for this game.
