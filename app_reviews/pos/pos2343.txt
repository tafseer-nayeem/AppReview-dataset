All of your Apps are amaziiing But one more thing, I wish you can create an App which can combine all of our recordings in drums, guitars, and bass guitar and we can compose a song. Hope you can do iiit
Full Metal Bass This app emulates all basses really well. Though I am a Lead Guitarist I like to play bass for Megadeth, Mayhem and Death because they have some awesome basslines. Megadeth's David Ellefson plays Picked Bass and has written some of the most evil and facemelting basslines out there. Necrobutcher of Mahem plays Distorted Bass and too has his share of evil basslines  I am taking about Varg's. Great App.
Great app overall This app is great for when I want to learn a song but don't have my bass with me. The only thing that would make it better would be an option to turn down the bass so my phone's speakers can play the sound better and I don't have to worry about blowing out my headphones. Also, what is immersive mode in the settings
Fun and Useful Great for composing musical ideas on the fly.  I wish the resulting sounds could be emailed or texted, but it still is very clever
This game rocks like punk rock I love this game... I keep playing Longview by Green Day... It's true.
Real bass Less interruptions than most others.sounds like REAL bass. Thank you
Too Legit to Quit This is one step closer to living my dream of playing the bass. Thank you Now I must learn to levitate.
Good app Looks like a bass,sounds like a bass,and has different kinds of bass.
Great bass app Distortion bass is the loudest, but all of the selections are nice. I've played all the bass apps and this one has the quickest response allowing me to play pretty detailed bass lines
Awesome... Is the a button that can stop the ringing of the string Thanks...
