The only problem I have is with the recent update. I've updated this app twice in the last 2 days. I still don't have the Franken Tom costume and no discounts on zombie eyes or fur. And, there are no ghosts flying around when I turn out the lights, let alone lightning. Obviously there is an issue. Please fix this.
Love it It is the best because it has so many fun mini games and Tom is so funny I could not ask for more besides the different ads that come up and the close should cost less
My talking tom Cat that said every thing you would say and also way to show off to your parent that you can take care for pet
Issues with new update I'm having the same issues as Randi Smith. The Lexus Ad causing me to have to restart my phone. There are no longer ghosts when the light is turned off. I'm level 129 and really don't want to have to Uninstall the game. Help
