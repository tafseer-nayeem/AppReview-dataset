Addictive and fun and frustrating I love this, its brilliant and the kids love it too
Awesome I love this game. I feel kinda stupid after playing
Stacie D Love this game Wish I could earn cheats without Fb or without buying them...and wish there were more levels but I love it anyway....makes u go duh
Can I get a lil bit more... HELP It's right there, right under ur nose, and yet u get left feelin stupid cuz ur over thinking the answer. I LUV IT  Brings me down from my 'now' and reminds me to relax and look at the question from a basic point of view there was a time when things were thought of with nothing more than necessary.  Stop constructing for the exeptional, when after all, its still founded on basic structure.......
Great fun Very abstract but fairly silly too. this will have you smacking your head like you've just pushed a door with a 'pull' sign on it.
Great game This game is really fun and gets u thinking...u can download what's my iq answers for helpit's free
Frustrating but good A great game which gets you thinking I played the free version then bought this one  it was worth it Some puzzles are quite frustrating but you get that with any sort of puzzle game. You're best to try the FREE version, and if you like that then buy this one Google or Youtube is helpful 
Pro my iq Great game, relax your mind and challenge it with silly question, one really think outside the box. Fun to play
Good game.... Makes me think a lot, its confusing but i like it Good job
Awesome This game is awesome it shows u how creative u can be and should be I think if u love out side the box brain teaser this is for you
Great App I like this game, but I do wish it had more levels.  And I wish there was another way to get the cheat points beside buying them.  But the game is still good.
Think outside the box I love this game and have my friends download it to challenge each other.
