Very handy Found it very handy to have on hand when wanting to know if I can eat something. Great amount of products listed.  I'm sure as time goes on it will continue to improve. Well done 
Exactly  what I needed. Keeps me informed on just what I need. Started this new lifestyle  six weeks ago, already reached my weight goal and no more headaches
Good info So far I have been vety happy with this app. It's comfortable to read and very easy to understand. I am just getting into the paleo lifestyle and feel confident that this app will help me along this journey.
Best app Very helpful and simplified Glad there is just a list of do and don't and no recipes That's the best part no recipes Love this app
It's a great help for someone just starting out on paleo,  as well as someone who comes upon a food they just aren't sure about.  Thank you
Great App Constantly Updated Love this all. Great for quick referencesand even has more in depth explanations on tricky foods. I really like how responsive the developer is. It seems like they're always making updates here and there and listening to feedback. Keep it up
Perfect Easy to read, understand, and very informative.
useful and simple I love it  It's easy to use, very cut and dry, and really helps me figure things out.
Pretty easy I just wish they had daily recipes on it. . Other than that. . Easy to use.
Great Super helpful when shopping. Not every brand name is on here but the ingredients list is easy to read and tell what is and is not paleo.
Yes Easy peasy Type in food and it gives you thumbs up or thumb down. Kiss
To the point If you're new to this lifestyle,  then this app is essential in jumpstarting the right way
Paleo Agreat app keeps me on the straight and narrow. Easy to use
