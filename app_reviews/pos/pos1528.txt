Nice to have I already own a calendar widget which I use everyday. I love the fact that the widget appears as a popup instead of switching of app.
Keep up this awesome blackberry like app for android. In love The more like blackberrys swipe the better all whilst keeping it lightweight, thanks dev Unlocked them all. Best app on android, can NOT live without now..... 5 stars, get it now for free as in SwipePad.... Steve
It Works No flaws, it does what it is programmed to do and does it well.
Works for me Works on HTC m7 kit Kat 4.4.2
Brilliant Helps in making all of your phone accessible. The widgets may appear small but you can still open them from anywhere. Great addon.  5
Cool apps .. We'll done treasures
Love it
Excellent Excellent job works as advertised
Updates please. Nice app and works well with widgetsoid for toggles.  No need to go to home screen. Access widgets anywhere anytime.
Works Well Does what it says it will do.  An honest addon.  Makes Swipepad very flexible.
I love it but How often does it license check cos I have no net at home so if its daily or anything I'm not going to be able to use it
I've been waiting for something like this I've been using swipepad for a while now, and every new addon they come out with just makes it better.
