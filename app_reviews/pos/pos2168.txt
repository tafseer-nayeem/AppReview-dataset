This game is stronger than any drugs Before downloading make sure that you don't have anything important to do with your life because once you play there is no way out of it
Running smooth Great looking game, runs smooth on my note 5. Great gameplay. Micro transactions can be annoying but you don't need them to actually play. Worth the 2 for this one
Best tower defense game app I have downloaded this game about once every year since it came out. Absolutely love it. Great graphics. A huge amount of towers. Many different levels to play and play them how you want too.  You cant go wrong. Only wish they came out with a 3rd instalment. Im dieing over here.
Best game on Android Best tower defense game. Smooth graphics, unique gameplay, very addicting. I download this again and again.
Great game Worthy of being a sequel. Unfortunately it freezes or completely crashes 7 out of 9 games. Aside from the highly detailed graphics and delightful sound.. I had to drop the rating a bit because of the problems I described.
Fun strategy game Really impressive. A lot better than fieldrunners 1. Its a superb strategy game. A bit addicted to earn all level heroic stars. 
It is Awesome U should download it. Its really fun when u get the chance to play it.......if u like killing games that is
So much fun the only thing they could improve is maybe 2 player You send the dudes while protecting your biz
Loads on Nexus 9  Great game. It's so much fun
Best tower defense game out there I was a fan of the original but they brought their A game this time. Amazing game play, graphics and weapons. I didn't spend a dime playing this and was still able to beat it in about a month. Thanks Atomic and keep 'em coming
Wanted to try it but it doesn't work on ART which Lollipop uses  Edit The newest version works well and is awesome Thanks for getting it going 
Awesome All levels completed  on 3 stars . No in app purchases needed.
