A real work of art My daughter immediately fell in love with the free version, had to spend the 3 on the full. I must admit, I love it myself. Brilliant graphics, creative themes, great classical music and standards. Great job.
Love it  Love it 3
Favorite  Nexus10 I love that my toddler can make it work by her big counterclockwise circles on the screen... Or I can set it to play automatically, enjoying the music and graphics in perfect time    I subscribed on their website so I'll find out when more apps become available  love it
Magical time... Magical time with this app Beautiful and so simple
Beautiful app Cool graphics and nice childhood songs, brings back good memories
Wonderful Beside the art, the tunes are wonderful, I particularly like Swan Lake
One of my fav apps Some apparently just can be always  helpful and useful. You just want to play the songs when you have a free moment. The idea of learning the stories is also excellent
