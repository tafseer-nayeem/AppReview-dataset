I can't watch videos I'm using OnePlus A0007 and right now, I can't seem to watch the videos my friends send me. Please have this fixed. Thanks in advance. Other than that the app is pretty awesome
Loveee Snapping The app works so much better than it used too. However I think the picture filters should be free...I'm not gonna pay for those.. Lol
