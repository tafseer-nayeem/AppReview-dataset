Just like I played as a kid. This game brings back memories. The AI at times can be a lil funny. I.E make trades that no rational human ever would, but it adds an interesting element to the game. Also the ability to mess with the starting settings a little bit is nice as well.
NICE IMPROVEMENT Before the latest update, I couldn't even downloaded it in my tablet because it was not compatible with my tablet's version. Now I finally could install it in my tablet and not only works great,but is much better than before. Great job EA
