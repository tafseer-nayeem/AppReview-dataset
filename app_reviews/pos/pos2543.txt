Purchased. Again. I can't own enough copies of this game. Got it for PS, PSP, iOS and FINALLY Android. Solid battle and party system, amazing storyline full of twists, masterful soundtrack, and those added cutscene are icing on the cake. Will buy again probably.
in love again for the 4th time... absolutely love it but definitely needs to make a virtual controller for it because the touch screen is iffy and I have a bunch of units so it makes a lot of things hard to do. and don't get me started on accidentally clicking defend smfh...
Still my favorite tactical RPG Played the original game way back on my PlayStation when I was younger, this game, in my opinion, aged like a fine wine. I find myself coming back and playing through the story over and over So happy that it got a remake and I personally will support this title to express my love for it.
So far so good perfect so far on Galaxy S6. Played through the opening fight scene no hiccups or slowdowns. The original FFT is my favorite game of all time. I hope this holds up.definitely playing to the end
Freaking amazing that this made its way to mobile devices HYPE  Now all we need is R2, and those elusive Fire Emblems and life will be gooooood 3
