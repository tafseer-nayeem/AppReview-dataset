We, parents love a game like this Too much awesome its nice to have a game not only for the  adults, also for the kids, not only for the enjoyment also for the learning's about this game. Its okey to have pop ups,  if no pop ups,  I think this game will not last long, don't know, thank you for this wonderful game 
Shows kids words as they go. Puzzles are still relatively challenging.  No obvious pop ups. Great
Great free puzzle Good for two to thee year olds. No app purchase necessary
