VERY CLOSE TO PC VERSION WHOEVER SAID THIS GAME IS LIKE FARMVILLE IS GOOFY IN THE BRAIN  YOU DONT PICK UP COINS AND CRAP LIKE THAT...ITS VERY SIMILIAR TO THE PC GAME WITH A FEW MINOR CHANGES....I HAVE BEEN HOOKED  I ALSO EVEN THINK THE PRICE WASNT TOO BAD FOR THIS GAME AS YOU CAN PLAY FOREVER JUST ABOUT I DONT RECOMEND MUCH...IN FACT THIS IS MY FIRST TIME, BUT I TOTALLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS GAME
Great fun I bit tedious but I'm playing on easy mode. It's fun learning as you go. Plays really well, and sounds good
Awesome This game is very cool It's dumbed down a bit to it's simplest form compared to it's pc counterparts,  but considering that's it's made for mobile it's totally worth the buy
