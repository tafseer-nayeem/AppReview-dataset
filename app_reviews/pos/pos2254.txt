Love this game This has always been one of my favorite card games. There are never enough people around to play the game with me so it is nice to be able to play on my phone anytime I want.
Great game Great game. I finally learned how to play thanks to this game. Levels are cool, runs smoothly on my Motorola, good graphics. Could use a wider character selection..... but other than that its great. Update after several app updates and an android software update, this game no longer works. Other games from developed works but not this one. I hope they fix soon.
Customer service at it's finest Mentioned in my old comment that the game crashed immediately. I know it takes some time to tweak,  but they were quick to fox the problem  Patience is always needed,  but as long as you tell them your platform or phone type, they will work to repair it  Thank you
Skipbo I love playing skipbo in real life and it is nice to find a game that is almost the same. I am very pleased and glad I bought it. I played the free version first and it was ad ridden but this is nice, smooth game play and I don't know what these other people are talking about it never freezes.
Sue H I always thought this was one of the best games. But now you got a down when you play one player instead of getting 30 cards you only get 10 why is that I think that stupid. I paid for this game I should get 30 card I want to fix that's ridiculous. I'm not happy with the new situation.
Thank you You have finally made a game I truly enjoy for free. Love the new features of being able to pick how many players and even play with my friends. Absolutely amazing
Just pay the two bucks and stop complaining people. Great game
Love the game. Had it for my NGBA for years. This plays great on my Samsung Galaxy 2. How many stinking times is this going to ask me to review it  It is very annoying
