Okay but Can't placing block with clicking on the block or in the block or remove block with holding. And if i'm clicking back button, show the menu. Change this feature so i can playing like minecraft. And don't spawn near the stone. I'm promise with you.
Well there is some problems...... I would give a five star rating if I could save my work because whenever I build something it never saves it and please  give it some life it would be really good to have a farm is r something because I could then play this s and not have to by the full thing or get Minecraft I would really adore that
I love this game I play this all the time I might be young but I understand this game more than the app. my brother bought the real minecraft but I did not understand the game controls. I do like the xbox version of minecraft but on android I like exploration lite thank you for reading this bye.
