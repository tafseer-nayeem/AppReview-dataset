After the downloading struggle. This game is great. I do recommend it The downloading is tough, after that, I'm glad it works. One thing, a trading feature within season mode Other than that game is great.
Fantastic I love this game and I am so glad the all star game bug got fixed Thank You The only thing that would make it better is if you incorporated trades withing the season mode, and create a trade deadline.
Roster Imports U need to make it possible to import roster changes into season mode wout having to start season over. Want new players on my team that were aquired at the trade deadline.
Great game but..... Hey I'm a huge baseball fan. I'm also a baseball history buff. It would be awesome if you could add a National league greats and an american league greats teams so players could play as greats such as Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Ted Williams, and Hank Aaron.
Standing Ovation... Best app I've downloaded this year...the graphics are outstanding on my android device.  Keeping statistical data is a great upgrade from the RBI 14 app along with being able to cut long throws from the outfield make the game more life like than ever before.
Best baseball game Most complete baseball game on android. Would really be great if it had the ability to trade players and have a create a player option, but overall it's worth purchasing.
Awesome upgrade from R.B.I. 14 I play this often, then recharge the tablet. Keeping '14 as it's the last game with Derek Jeter. Graphics and Stadium designs are great. But sometimes it glitches, two batters appear simultaneously on occasion. Doesn't stop me from loving this game.
Love it It's a great game to play,and with Roster updates and super good graphics.It is one of the best baseball games ever.Let's Go Blue Jays
Hg Very fun game it's easy to work with just very fun on so many levels it's not difficult
