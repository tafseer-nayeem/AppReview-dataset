Love it It's very handy when you don't have your phone handy. I wish this was the native popup notification so we could reply from the notification. Thanks dev
Dr. Rachelle I just purchased mine, and i already love it. I like more of the fact that when i am recieving a call i can glance at my watch rather than fish for my phone either in my pocket or in my holster so i can decide whether or not to answer And to quickly reply to a text thats important, its the Best  i never thought i would like a gaget like this nearly as much as i do. It is Awesome 
Thumbs up It actually works quite well. Though there is sometimes a delay like having to tap the correct button a few times before it will spell something out. I really don't mind it.
Nice for Gear fit writing directly from it and send The ap installed quick and work. Little freeze sometimes when you use the keyboard. But finally its ok. For direct replying from received message I dont know if this Working
It works It works Need better explanation of how to setup the notifications... But works great
