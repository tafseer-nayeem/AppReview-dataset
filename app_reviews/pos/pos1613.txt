LG Volt Guided view is awesome. Got some free comics from marvel and decided to use comixology since you can get nonmarvel comics too and now I'm addicted. Go to the website and set yourself up to get free comics without a card or paypal. Then download them to the app for free from your list of purchased comics. I recommend buying some comics though after you get into it. Comixology is awesome.
Love it Discovered so many great comics from the free previews and I love the subscription feature. The new issue of my favorite series are already available on my app before I wake up on Wednesdays.
Huge fan Great app, I love digital comics,at first I was unsure about it, but digital has me completely hooked. I love the guided read feature, makes following the panels a breeze, especially on smaller galaxy sized devices. Highly recommended.
A Comic Lovers Dream Anyone who readscollects comics will love this app. No more store visits and having to house a giant collection in boxes that take up rooms.
They should add skailla For u who dont know what skailla is look it up on the enternet, its so addicting, and fun to read
Best of the best Best version every.                                       And best app I own. Thank you
