Great game Only complaint is the DLC that they add on to get the full experience.
Fun  Addictive c,, A Great Game For All Ages. Graphics  Sounds Are Amazing. Highly Recommended It. 
Really fun but you must have the time to help kids under 8 play.
Fun, funny and laid back entertainment Smooth game play little to no lag. Annoying same ads, every time you progress to another stage. Hopefully paying 1.99 for this will stop that announce .
Oh boy My son always like this game.
