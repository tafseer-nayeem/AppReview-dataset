Works great Minor issues as with any gps really but the app is great. Free trial and inexpensive membership 20year or so, maps can be downloaded though you need 5G of space for north america. It feels like a real Tomtom without the initial investment.
Brilliant People moan about having to pay for apps but this is worth the annual fee, easy to use, gps is quick to connect, easy to find any place when in a hurry. The live traffic is the best. If you drive a lot then this is worth having.
