I love it The reason why I love it because you can do any kind of cake and its suitable for anyone who likes to make cakes so.  I think I should have the right to rate this app as a good one 
I WISH I CAN RATE IT 1000000000 stars Nice looking game so for 3 4 and 5 game perents you're kids are so safe
Cake maker It's a really great game
Really good This game was really good I really liked when you could have a layered cake instead of just one layer.
 I love it
I love my mom Chloe mitchell
I love it but... I would rate half a star because some things cost REAL money and I would not call it make a cake I would call it decorate a cake. I think this is a game for all ages.
