Notifications commingled hours late just got notification west out with hamstring for second half,game ended over 5 hrs ago it's 930pm getting notifications from noon games
One of the best sports app Extremely good app, highly recommend to all. BR is one of the best.
Fantastic The only app a sports enthusiast will ever need. My wish list would be to include badminton and volleyball.
Love this app. Everything in one location. This app made me delete a lot of apps that only did one sport, this does them all besides NBA DLEAGUE
