Could ask no more This is a wonderful port of the new classic board game for a fraction of the cost. The expansions are a bit bare bones, but come at a very good price. The only complaint I have is that the online community is not very active.
Crashes Great game and great app. There were some freezingcrash issues early on, but it looks like the bugs have been worked out. Thanks
Found a bug When NPC Heroic Halflings came onto the board and only took 3 regions, they couldn't play second Hero token and game froze.
Really good implementation Days of Wonder have done a great job in the Android version of Small World. The AIs are neither stupidly easy nor stupidly hard, and the headtohead mode is really good.  It'd be nice to have some more of the expansions available.
