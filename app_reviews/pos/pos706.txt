Update not so great... After the most recent update of the PAID version all titles added get set as READ even if the box in the settings is unchecked. Should be an easy fix.
Just what I wanted Best comic collection app ever.
The Developer listened, now works This app was not working properly for some time, could not look up comics, and performance got laggy.  I emailed him, he asked for exact problem, which I provided. The developer got an update out that evening, and now it works This us the best comic app I've seen, and developer works with you  fantastic
Best of the Bunch After trying about ten different comic collection apps, this one is the clear standout, even surpassing the spendier CLZ Comics. Highly recommend. Much prefer the old icon to the new one, though. I guess the idea is to emulate Material Design throughout, but let's not completely jump the shark about it.
Great for large collections Love this app, great for when I can't remember what issues I have when I go to the comic shop.
Cannot delete comics Thanks for a great app I can't believe a single programmer wrote this from scratch
Love it Best thing for keeping track of all my comic books
