Won't log in I don't know exactly when this started but when I went to sign in today it would not let me log in. The Password button doesn't even seem to acknowledge your press. I can still log into my account online.
Convenient Much more convenient to schedule my mortgage payment via the app than on the computer. However, the Save Username doesn't work as it should for me. When I open the app, my username is there, but when I enter my pw, it fails to log me in everytime.
