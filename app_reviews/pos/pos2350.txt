Awesome I bought this app because I was so impressed with the free version I thought the developer deserved payment. I use it all the time, my pen and paper have become redundant. If you are looking for a great app that does what it says with no frills or fuss then this is the one you should choose.
It works now I turn my phone off and turn my phone back on and I guess that did the trick. Great work on this love it glad I was able to pay for it. You deserve it
Does exactly what I need it to and doesn't require any permissions. Perfect.
Nice Works well so far. Please add more themes.
Does what it says Grill little app, wouldn't say no to more themes but good enough as it is
Awsome No fancy bells  whistles,  just good work Devs. And doesn't ask for tons of permissions.
I love it's versatility Super app.
The best note ever I like it
Great Awsome and Simple Note
Great widget Support developers
Love iiiit
