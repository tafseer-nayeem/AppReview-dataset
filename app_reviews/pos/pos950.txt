And now, another damn problem I cant be heard. Not on headphones, not on phones mic. Can you fix it please  As i said, i really need this app. Please do something.
SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 4  5.1.1 Team Speak app works good again with PTT Overlay back on track. Please don't remove it again in future updates
Awesome Never had even the slightest problem since i bought it way back when.
Awesome.   No problem with it.  Except, I don't really want it to black out while I'm talking on a server.
I was hesitant with this at first, but at only 2 I wasn't really concerned with the price.. I'm happy to say that this works better than I expected on my Moto G phone. I hate having to leave a conversation while people are talking, and now I don't have to.. or I can be in 2 channels at once to help coordinate with 2 different squads, or report trolls without leaving my channel..   This is awesome 
Works great on S5 I can connect to my favourite T.S. server and talk to my friends whenever I want now Thanks Teamspeak.
Works perfect I never had any trouble using it
Great app idd I have never regretted purchasing the app
Awesome Great app..not even crashes 1s till now. Simple ui..fast.........
