a class act I hadn't played the boardgame in quite a while, but the campaign got me back on that bicycle in no time.  It would be nice to be able to zoom, but fortunately, I can still play anyway.
Worth the money Challenging but not to the point of throwing my android device though it crossed my mind when I first tried it.  Now even after countless plays and completing puzzle mode it is still my go to.
Love it I love the board game and I think it is great that I have the ability to play it on my phone now
Fantastic Analysis Game Recommended for fans of SimCity and Carcassonne or Alhambra. Build a city tile by tile, each with varying costs and benefits. Think long term to win. Lots of single player challenges, an AI to play against, and online play. Unbeatable value.
Hex based city simulator This game has hexes in it. I got badly frightened by a hex once, so I was naturally apprehensive. However, I needn't have worried. This app is also a board game. I can't comment on how well it translates as the board game is never in print. I hope to see a copy one day, a story to pass onto my grandchildren...right, this game is good. It's also very addictive, which is why I uninstalled it. Is this review contrary Yes, yes I believe it is...
Awesome Very interesting and fun game I love it  It is probably best to go over the rules briefly, then play for a bit, and then reread the rules.
Awesome Just be aware that tiles in place at start of campaign missions don't count as linked until you add a connecting tile
Great game love the campaign as well as playing vs AI.
Needs more local play setup randomness, but really fun
Love the game. Short single player though.
Very comfortable and fast UI. Please add customisable AI difficulty levels.
Well done I support any board game implementation on Android, but this one is especially worth the money
Great app The only flaw is you can't disable the launch music
