My favorite game The only issue is sometimes it freezes up or hesitates badly but usually resolves quickly.  Overall, my favorite game. 
 I absolutely love this game I'm so addicted to it. My battery is always going low because I'm constantly on this app. I have no problems with it what so ever  Love Love Love  I just wish the lives wouldn't take so  to refill lol .
Entertaining I never keep apps past a few days. This game kept me interested. The ads weren't too annoying. I really wish they would come out with more levels
I love the panda bubbles.  I like the different levels. It's  really amazing to me.  Keep up the amazing games coming.  Love much to you all gals and gents. Wonderful Peaceful Loving Sincere.
Just fun Simple, colorful, cute, totally enjoyable.  It's an unwind game.  Entertaining without the stress of a war type game.  Really done well.
Better than panda pop You actually can earn everything you need instead of paying money...you get paid red gems for videos and earn gold the better you play... There are some ads but not to bad... It's fun and challenging... Every level is different.. and they explain new objects to you.. the only thing is the higher level you go the more gold it cost to use specials birds so save your gold. It's a fun and game. I broke my leg so it helps pass the time and I always want to play the next level
Love improvements At first I was given a cautionary sign and reluctantly had to uninstall and was unable to pass one play. I enjoyed this game very much I find it quite funny when the man laughs hahahuhuhu... Very unusual laugh that makes me laugh as well. this November I turn 52 and half pound that I am enjoying this child's game immensely. so glad I kept the star marked on this game. Thank you so much for a very enjoyable and addicting game. thank you
