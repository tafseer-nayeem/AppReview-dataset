Wow..... Just try JOY REWARDS App Using this referal d 1816147 and earned points.. you can use the points for any games specially The Clash of Clans...
Strategy and action at its best Sure, I like action games. But this takes it to a whole other level. With being able to design your own defense, and trying to beat other people's defences, this game asks for thinking, strategy, and skill. The only thing I wish is that there would be an offline mode, so you could play it without Wifi or using data. Otherwise, 5 stars.
WOW.. Just try WILD WALLET App Using this referal d 1050157 and earned points.. you can use the points for any games specially The Clash of Clans...ok
So awesome so coooool love it love IT its the best game ever this game omg is the BEST IT'S ONE OF MY SO SOOOOOOO AWESOME GAMES
King of Thieves is Amazzzing The GEM of all games, Zeptolab  you guys have done it again. King of Thieves is very addictive, funny, and full of surprises. Truly loved it. This game is going to be the next Candy Crush.
AWESOME This game is one of my favorites now. I mean I do dislike some things like how you have to have internet to play but it probably can't be helped. Anyways its a good game and I do recommend it to anyone.
So good A lot like clash of clans, but easier and more fun. Knowing the creator had to beat there own dungeon makes every dungeon beatable.
Love this game This game is the best. The one thing I do not like is if you run out of picking keys you have to use a amount of you orbs and get the full amount or whach a add and only get two picking locks. Great game
