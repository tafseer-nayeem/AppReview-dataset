About the best video editor around
The best video editor The best video editing app.. 
Very cool  FunEasy to use....Highly recommend This is one of my most used video editors.   I shoot several videos daily and edit alot if the picsvideos I shoot into video.  This is THE ONLY APP THAT DOES EVERYTHING I NEED without having to use other apps.  I have the pro edition and recommend the upgrade after trying out the free one.  I really like the new themes and expansion of music library you provide.  I highly recommend this video editor
