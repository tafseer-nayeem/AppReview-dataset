Awesome This game is super fun I have not yet had even a single glitch on my nexus 7. Totally worth 7.it just lags a little bit on racing levels but I can live with that.
Fix with a update Works great my only problem is on the mission attack on the Rebell the six mission in the fourth episode it always freezes it's the only mission that freezes and you really need to fix this because I beat the game and that's the only mission I can't complete I have a galaxy note 4
Found bug Won't let me enter levels on my custom character tried the arcade on stranger 1 and did not work then tried a level and both times the game crashed and said unfortunately lego SAGA has stopped
Great no lag for me People are complaining of lag but I have no lag at all this app would be great if you could connect a controller such as the moga or other brands still love it though
Now runs on nvidia shield portable controller works and gameplay appears very smooth running but still bugs graphical issue on death star escape episode 4 end scene. And the last level on episode 4 crashes the game mid level
