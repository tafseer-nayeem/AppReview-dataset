I never buy anything If it isn't totally free to play a game, I don't play it.  Currently I have something like 7 million coins just playing and not buying anything. And besides that, it is a fun easy way to spend 3060 seconds.
BJWDBLITZ Been playing forever And was lucky and got the million 1 time years ago,suggestion loosen daily spin and make regular game play like challenge play more people will play again
Awesome, it is very addictive.  Wish they still kept the hearts and rocketsI love the game, but do not like some of the playing selectionssome are much too slow.  The ones with more action cost too much to play  Some times I can Plat them but not as much as I would like because of them being too expensive and the coins cost too much  Please take my feed back and make some changes  You have an awesome game but the action selections cost too much, can't afford to play as much as I would like 
Love I enjoy this game. Would be nice to have a goal to work toward though rather than just endless repetitive  play
