Great app For .99 this app is great. I have multiple accounts and took me five minutes to setup the way I wanted with passwords on each account. Easy to use and love the easy interface. For a simple checkbook register with some bells and whistles this is awesome. If you want an accounting program then get Quick Books
Best app for FMLA tracking I loved the free version until the ads popped up. I have used the Free version for 9 months so I bought it to eliminate the ads
Note 3 Works great and love the update. This app has helped me not to bounce any checks or debts on my bank account. I am getting a tablet at the first of the year and can't wait to use the sync for both phone and tablet
Great app I really like this app, the ease of use, the looks of it, and how well I can customize it. What I DON'T like is that for some reason, I am now unable to access it I paid for the adfree version and had no issues at first. Now every time I try to open it I get an error message and a choice to send a Report. I emailed the creator. UPDATE 11814 Gary emailed back with a fix...apparently my phone did something weird to it. I had to clear the account data, but it's working now. Yay
AWESOME Want to save trees. This app will help and it helps balance the books. A must have.
This Is A Smart Simple Check Book App. I even changed phones for this app.
Just like a paper ledger Love this app Just like having a paper checkbook ledger. Totally what I was looking for.  Fast support from the Dev also.
So simple I love this app Great job, it's exactly what I was looking for. I used the free version for about a week then paid. I use it every day. Thanks
Great Like this app One suggestion.. would like an account summary button in the main menu instead of menuaccount optionsaccount summary. One click account summary would be even better.
