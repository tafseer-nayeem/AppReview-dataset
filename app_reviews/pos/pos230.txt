Spoton nikon Updated the app. Has my new scope and has new bells and whistles with a wind meter.Not sure how that will work but great concept.I upgraded this app from one star to a 5 now my issue has been resolved. After a little prodding Nikon has set a new standard.
Great App I have been using this app for about 3 yrs now.. I shot my bull at 625 yrds, the app and my hand loads worked like a charm..
Poor man's long range I've had this app for 4 years now and have loved it. Shooting a Browning ABolt II in .270 I've taken 2 cow elk at over 650 yards each, 1 bull elk at 250, 2 muleys at under 100, and 1 muley at 820  It's not perfect, but you didn't pay 2K for your optics and rifle each... Get accurate input info and take the time at the range to test your weapon and ammo with the app, or fork out the dough. One request, please add 26 Nosler.
Awesome app.  Works great Zeroed  100 yards.  Shot 34 inch group  200.  Just for giggles shot 114 inches  400 yrds.   Then shot 2 inches  500.  Finished with 212 inches              600 yrds.  Used Remington model 7 in .300 SA Rem ultra mag wNikon bdc and Remington core lock 165 grain factory ammo.   Rest on concrete bench with sand bags.  Even splitting bdc bubbles on some shots.  All three shot groups.   Couldn't believe the accuracy of the program.
3.2 inch grp at 600 It works
Awsome app Works every time for me. Very informative
Great app has my 300 Win Mag my grain bullet. Thanks works great.
App is right on. Used it all last year with three different weapons 7 mm Mag, 308, and 3006 all with different ammo. Even tested the weather portion of app and found it to be pretty good but not as good as my old spotter. No problems at all with app used on three types of phones.
