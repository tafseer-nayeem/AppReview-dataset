Good that I don't need to install FB app Good that I don't need to install FB app to chat. It is humongous, and my crapy device, does not know how to install on internal sd, which is pretty free, but install into internal memory, witch is full.
Could not able to use the app in my xiomi Redmi MI set, as it prompt me that I am using a developer version of messenger. Please help to resolve my issues.

New phone, new problems When im sent gifs on my Samsung galaxy s6 edge white boxes come out or some gifs just dont work. I would try it onnmy galaxy s5 and it would work. And this phone is brand new. I told my friends to send me gifs through kik, and it works perfect there. So there is something going on between the galaxy s6 edge and gifs on messenger. Thats not cool . Can you guys fix it please
