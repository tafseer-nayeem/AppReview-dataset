Is awsome strategy game so good But if you don't have pegasus then I quit from it
One of the most fairestbalanced war games. Love the battle system and the fact that everyone isnt shielding 247 like game of war. Gems are cheap and can get you far if you use them right. No massive packs so paying players really have to pay to get the upperhand. Very fair and very balanced.
