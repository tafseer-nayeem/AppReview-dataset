Fun This game is a lot of fun, but the second time I played it I encountered a glitch. When I went to close the game on my phone, the music from the game continued to play even after the app closed. Had to restart my phone to make it stop. Other than that and the fact that you have to pay extra to get certain venues, this is a great game
Miss this kind of game A LOT  Too many games have to be played by waiting energy to recharge, or to buy online, or if not we have to wait like forever. And playing with friends Wasting time. Oh how i miss this good old fashioned game...
Wedding dash Awesome game works good.  Freezes alot Wish this could be fixed So worth the money though. Frustrating to keep shutting it down and restarting my tablet everytime it freezes.  Will give better ratings when issue is fixed.
Like it, but expensive It is a great and very addictive game, but very expensive. Not only do you have to pay almost R40, but that doesn't even give you all the levels, yoy have to pay an additional R60 to get all levels. Cost me R100 for everything
Love I've had a thing for Diner Dash ever since I could remember. I'm loving every addition to the Dash family. I've purchased them ALL
