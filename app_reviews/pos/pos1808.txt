Loading problems My facebook keeps loading slow. I go to my browser and see if its working and it goes to everysite. But when i go back to the app, its still loading. Might take 5 minutes to start acting right again. When i go to pages or refresh feeds, the circle just spins and spins. And my WiFi A1. So i know its not me. Fix yall app man
Amazing I love this app I used to have tons of friend and I would go do stuff on the weekend's. Not any more thanks to facebook, that has now completely consumed my time. I don't really go out and see real people any more but on the plus side I have over 800 friends on Facebook that I never talk too. But all in all its an ok app. MESSENGER SUCKS  Why have a separate app that's just annoying . just put MESSENGER in Facebook
