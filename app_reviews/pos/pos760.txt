Flat out the best Want a first class file browser on steroids You can do as I did and tried them all, only to find that they all fall short compared to this one... Download this one and you've got the best.   Acer A100 7 Tablet. Android 4.03  System upgraded from 3.x
Worthwhile Some users seem to be having issues with the developer or app, but I have found nothing wrong. The key disables ads, and if you've had issues after an update of the app with ads resurfacing, simply reinstall the key app and they will disappear worked for me on the Nexus 4.
Had this on my G1 when that first came out and i got the paid version for my G2. One request option to open file with browser if possible. 5 stars
Lately it has been very slow I have been using the Pro version for about 2 months. It's been all good.
Versatile  flexible Does everything I expected and more. The menu key and long press options are useful  sensible. Worth supporting
Mikey Works great on Galaxy S3.  By far one of the best apps out there. Running PRO cause I hate ads
Good at what it does Does a good job at presenting the filesystem to you and giving you copy paste features and options for integrating the most common cloud storage services. Stays simple and easy to use. Not whizbanged beyond usability.
