Habit Forming It's absolutely great I enjoyed it so much that I bought a real machine from a local gaming store.
It's... hypnotic... It is so weird, I could sit there and play this game all day, thankfully there's no real parlors around here.
Best pachinko game

Finally, a real pachinko game Among the best of the very few real pachinko games in English for android, thanks for giving us this great app
Cool game is now even better with mute feature.  A perfect recreation of my real pachinko machine.
Fun, kidfriendly, cool game What a fun game I am not a gamer but this was great and even I could figure it out Can't wait for my nieces to try to play 
Neat Little Game This is a great game to pass the time. It picks back up right where you left it, so it is easy to start and stop. I was also impressed that it does not require any permissions on my phone. I always wonder why apps need so many permissions. Overall this game is well worth downloading.
Great Fun game. Easy to play and watch TV or call someone at the same time
Fun Great for wasting a few minutes
