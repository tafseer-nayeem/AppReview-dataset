Warning  Bonifide Catan Addict I own every version this game, including the packaged board games. I play online with my sons 28  30 years old. This new android app is my favorite version. And the developer's support team is responsive and comes up with solutions, not excuses. Great game, from an equally great company.
No need for central heating Love the game however there are multiple issues. My phone, running Android 6.0 is using about 1 battery per minute and the phone gets almost too hot to hold. Also would be nice to be able to go to the gamesettings menu when its not your turn. Especially online while waiting..
Addictive. Huge fan of the board game. This is surprisingly addictive and plays well. However the dice is stacked no matter what the developer says. The proof. When the Robber lands on your tile that number will almost always role next which is impossible if the dice is random. The AI play as a team to make up for their ineptitude. A human would win every game if the playing field was level. Despite these faults the game has kept me hooked since its release.
Good for fun. Hard to fault apart from the AI are never as much fun as playing with real people I really enjoyed the campaign however.
Does not work on galaxy tab S Trouble installing due to the SD card being in. Removed and works great The only complaint is the cities and knights expansion doesn't have very many scenarios, wish they would add more otherwise very fun game.
Just like the board have I actually learned how to play with this app, then play the board hand with friends. Great game.
Catan Online After unsuccessfully registering for Catan Online on my own I contacted the customer support. After about three days I was successful in creating a Catan account. I do enjoy this app.
Great A lot of people complain about the AI ganging up on the leader, but that's what happens in Catan comps. All hardest opponents on hard difficulty setting are actually pretty beatable.
