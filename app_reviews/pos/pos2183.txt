Highly Recommended It's truly an exciting game. I tried similar games but ended up uninstalling them because they're not as exciting as Zynga's Looney Tunes Dash.
Wow..... Just try WILD WALLET App Using this referal d 1O5O157 and earned points.. you can use the points for any games specially The Clash of Clans...
I love it I like it because its realy fun I just want to tell you guys if you have any problem with looney tunes it MUST be your phone
Childhood returns So unique and good time consuming gme. Loving to play different characters and waiting for next to come 
It's cool, but... I wish that the music would go on when playing a level because, the music stops and you're left feeling a bit empty while running through the levels. Could the creators update that Please. 
Entertaining It is really fun and cool because in this game there are different obstacles getting in your way. It is not like Subway Surfers, Despicable Me, temple run or anything that has the same boring old obstacles. 
Love this game I love this game,  only problem is I'm always waiting for new levels,   finished greedy for speedy a couple days ago,  How much longer for new levels
