Great game Worth every penny but if he made more beast hero's dang I would pay 10 dollars for it if there was 50 hero's man I recommended this game to 10 of my friends and they loved it keep going producer
Awesome but I love this game but when I press the but button to upgrade a weapon or shied , it upgrades it to max and wastes my coins so can you fix that. But other then that THIS GAME IS AWESOME  
Love it Very addictive and huge replay value. For 10 it was a steal. Just wish more gems would appear.
LOVE IT I like how there's a auto pick up during the battle so u don't have to worry about picking up equipment during the fight, love the fact that it's and offline game, if there was a survival type stage were endless hordes of enemies would come at u..... that would be cool to see, the only thing I see wrong is when the game loads, I lages a little and I get a little mad because I'm ready to beat the living snot out of my enemys. I can't wait for further updates.
Addicting The gameplay is badass. Beating the living daylights out of some evil monster seems to be a great way to relieve me of stress. Love the heroes, wish they had stories though, so I could see some personalities. I'm absolutely in love with their attacks, quite unique, I'd say. Recommended for people who like to blow monsters into pieces with lightning and Jack in the box bombs 
ITS GREAT This game is good and I love it so much thanks for such a great playable game
Amazing This game is very refreshing, thrilling, and fun. My money is surely not wasted with this game though it would be better if you fix the crashes. But still a good work Dreamsky
Great Mobile Game I Love Pretty Much Everything About This Game...I Wish They Had More Characters To Choose From But Maybe Theyll Add More Next Year With A Update Or Something Idk
