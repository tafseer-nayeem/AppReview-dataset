Love this game.
Fixed The game is good but it can't beat the original. I don't understand why,  when you fold your hand, the river is good, but when you continue betting it's garbage hence my opinion of the game being fixed. I also don't understand why your opponent can get chips when THEY HAD A LOSING HAND I didn't spend money to lose to a character that doesn't follow the rules of poker.
New review for the recent update Game was pretty fun despite multiple bugs crashes, missing text.  Recent update has cleared up everything so far  Well done
Cute game I tried this poker game just because it had a cute theme but its actually pretty fun to play.

It's a different and unique style of poker game compared to other Texas hold'em games.
