Love  I love this app, but I would love it even more if it would tell you when auctions were set to be for items you've set reminders on.
Sindy's Review  this sounds like a really nice company to deal with. They have lots of nice things. Don't know what to say here as a description It all looks good.
Unbelievable. Savings I've never had a problems with this app,  I've won some fantastic items that you would think I spent a lot of money on but the best part is the one who bids last is the winner and I have been winning.  Customer service is just a click away,
Lo v e this app I get really good quality stuff at cheap prices
It was love at first bid Fast pace auctions and the really fun part is that the things you bid on and  win are the hard to find ltems for the pickier people on your list.
So far everything I have purchased I have been very pleased with.
