It really works Live Celtics games Sad about missing my Celtics games when not at home needed to try a app like this. Quick easy set up using my xfinity accound and presto Watching the Celtics live on my phone. I knew apps like this existed just didn't know how easy and good it could be. Watching it on WiFi so not sure how it would be on regular data. I am wicked happy right now  go Celtics
Good quality picture The picture quality is excellent on my Nexus 6. The volume level is very loud. big plus It's also very responsive on the transitions. Now I can watch the blacked out NHL games. A well designed app...A
Love the streaming This app allows me to watch my favorite sports no matter where I am
Gives me instant access to my NASCAR races while I'm on the go.  Very nice app.
