wow I have downloaded flipkart and amazon at 11.45 pm so i have earned rs.95. but it didnt showed in my account. but when i opend the app again in the morning i gorlt the balance in my account.
Offers a lot more credit than other apps. Though the user interface is not great. But its light on resources as well.
Didn't used it yet It says if I rate dis app it will give me 30 rs..lets c wat happens..hope fr d bst..
If I really get money then its really have to be 5 stars apps. Just now it shows rate us and get 30 rs lets see wat happen.
Really a Shit kuchh bhi nahi hota hai. Na app download karne par aur nahi 5 star rating dene par.
Nt able to get my credit..... Fake app ever seen... Told to rate 5 star then ill get 30 rd let's see what happens hope for d best
Pravesh.... I have to give 5 star becouse I want to see it work or not....maine 5star diye h AGR reward mila to subko infonm krunga
Fake app hai sala He guys don't download this all fake aap hai...bus time vest hai sala harami
Angry I was thinking that This app is good but I was wrong because this is not giving any balance except when I downloaded this app. After that I was downloaded two apps but didn't receive anything. So I am angry.
My experience This app says to give 30 rs to give it 5 star and to give a review so don't believe any of it. Secondly it says to have a minimum recharge amount of 10 but it is actually 50. I am on this app for hours now but haven't gotten any recharge but I think it works so install it of you have a lot of time
