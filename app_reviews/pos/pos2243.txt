Frustrated I recently upgrade phone to the LG v10 and for some reason when I open the app it slide to the right side instead of the center like the other games or previous phone don't know if it's the phone well it work fine with the others games but this one maybe something need to be done. Thank you

Need coins anyone plz 4Hrs is to long to wait but watching other lobbies is crazy with over 1,000 players per lobbie nice. Help need coins.
One of the best slot apps... Great slot app but would be better if they let you win more often. The only time they seem to let you win is right before leveling up...

Was a 5 then crashed and burned, then fixed.. Was a 5 then when I walked away from my phone and got back, my session  expired and I lost over 1 million coins I had accumulated I got in touch with customer support and it was fixed in less than a minute with all my coins back. Awesome service
