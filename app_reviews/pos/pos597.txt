Awesome game Kinda like it...house makeover is gud....but i hate that a new room unlocks after so much time or days...and between this time we have to fix old houses again
Samsung tab 3 This is a very good game but I want and wish all the game is free like basement like those rooms
Wonderful game. You all need to learn to read. In app purchases means you will have to pay after you finish the demo. They are into making money. If something you worked hard on was given away for free you wouldn't like that very much would you. Grow up. It's not even that exspencive.
Awesome I think it is also me because if you bye everything you get certent tasks every day in the game
This game is so cool but they could of have unlocked everything instead of us having to pay for it on PayPal.
Love it very nice but others are locked please unlock it Awesome game I just love itb
I love it It is a great game for little girls my little girl loves it so much It is easy for little girls
Looooooovvvvvvvveeeeeee iiiiiiiittttttt Kind of Cool ot will be better if you unlock all the rooms instead of troubling to buy them
Fix It Girls I love this game  But you need to update for another rooms
