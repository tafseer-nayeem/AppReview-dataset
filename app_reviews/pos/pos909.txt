Great app Great product.  Syncs well with edge 810 and easyseamless link with strava
Works great Haven't had any issues with syncing my fennix 3  on nexus 6 or my LG v10.  The current version is so much better then the original.
Good app does its job Colorful and dark, it's beautiful
Use this app daily.  The data presentation works well for me.
Better It does what I need it to.  Thanks.
Will return to 5 stars once fixed Unable to connect to the Garmin servers or sync my vivofit with my phone since the newest update.
Absolutely love it
