My baby brother loves this game and knows it all
Awsome My daughter love this
Amazing My son has autism and there is very little thay holds his attention for long. This app is his new favorite thing. He plays all the games and is learning math and spelling. The variety of games is great and they are educational too, bonus. This app helps to calm him down if he is going through a fit, which that alone is a lifesaver. Best 5 bucks I've ever spent.
Awesome app for my 3 yr old son. Totally worth the money. It has everything in a toddler app.
