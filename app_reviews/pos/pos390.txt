Like the game but it's been eating coins for the last couple of weeks. I'd leave coins on there and the next day they would be gone. Or I'd win and it wouldn't put the coins up to the my pot. So far it's shorted me about 200,000 worth of coins
GSN Slots I really enjoy playing the game, You just don't give any free tokens why not Not fair
GSN is one of the first and best in online gaming. It is an AUTHENTIC game with a half hour bonus to add to your winnings. GSN is financially confident, they have NO ANNOYING POPUPS like so many. The payoffs are good and steady, the playing simple. SUPPORT this app, you will not regret it. GSN keeps it REAL
