Graphics Whenever you're hiding in a green virus it doesn't become smaller.main screen is awesome and more skins  .also coins.I'm lovin' it
It's amazing I've played this game so much I'm used to getting eaten. I love playing this game. Also I wanted to say that there should be all the animatronics from the 1 scary game five nights at Freddy's. They should cost around 10002000 coins for this update. But anyways thanks for the game
babe  LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH IT IS SO FUN BUT SOMETIMES I GET MAD AT IT WHEN I GET ATE I OMOST BROCK MY PHONE ONE TIME SO YOU SHOULD GERT THIS APP IT IS REALLY FUN
Great Game Great Game played this on my computer and Its amazing. Glad that they added it to phones. 1 Thing that would make it better is if you add different modes like experimental and hunger games.
Love this game it's perfect It never gets boring because your always in a different situations. My sons and I play it and we have all made it to number 1 on the leaderboards.
