Its a good app to know the status and enquiry of the train accurately.. No more knowledge is required to know about the app.                                             A person who generally use the phone is used this app very easily..try it
Best app for checking passenger trains, spotting trains, and many other things zero ads. A few feature requests that would have made it perfect  1. most important Show past queries in each section, which can be reinvoked with a click.  2. An optional input for time of departure in Trains Between Stations section trains departing only after the specified time should be shown.   3. CancelledRescheduledDiverted Trains sections should have a filtersearch option.  4. PNR status checking facility.
It is best app to enquire about trains. It help a lot. Now no need to leave home early for trains and wait in a queue in front of the enquiry counter. Very helpful. And so user friendly.

For officials Please also add a facility to check PNR Status. For Users Its a very good app but in a feature Spot Your Train it gives you sufficient information but with little delayed update. In short best app on Android for railway enquiry if they also add pnr status facility.

Good, train running status creates confusion between  today and tomorrow if train delays to other day
