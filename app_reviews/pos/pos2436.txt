LOVE IT I love this game because I've been playing this game for years,but I Hove to say this game is addictive so if ur not going to play every week then U might aswell not download it. JUST SAYING
Gifts We can now give gifts Yay ONE thing id add is being about to trade , and adding stuff to yr wl also Being able to change the color for vip and animation on yr profile
Awesome but... Can you add the face expressions So we can choose the faces. Or maybe giving greets
THANKS SOOO MUCH I'm super happy now U guys made my dayy finally now i can give gifts and see them thank u sooo much my friend was like look at ur gifts I said I can't then she said get the update I was oml really Yesss thanks so much guys
Need more fun Can u plzzz make us see our wl and more plzzzz
More games please You should add more games and I think it's stupid that you have to buy vip
I love the way it is made now with gifts but i would like to see my wishlist too
 Can we get free VIP  Shut up to everyone saying can we get free VIP because if that happens then everyone will just make new users  keep on doing it to either greet themselves or for a backup so shut the heck up about that. Reporting it as spam if i see anyone talking about it on the reviews. Don't like it Then buy VIP or earn it in competition or by doing things for your family.
Awesome D D llovve it I wish I could give it 10000 starrrs
Love the new update Thanks u for making gifts on tablet possible
