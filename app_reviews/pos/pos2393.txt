One of the best Ive played alot of racing games in my days.this is by far one of the best.it actually takes skill to play.i love the way u have to launch the car.keep up the good work.....needs a way to trade ur cars.then it would be untouchable
Amazing I've observed some great improvements done to this game over the past year and I have to say it's changed my experience of drag racing in game. I would like to just suggest a few things along with Levi's down in the reviews below. Along with trading feature, distance drags, and the ability to tune the gears if one buys the pro tranny. That is all for now. Thanks.
good game Need just to fix glitches and hacks please otherwise excellent game and please dont play on tournaments yet u will freeze there and each time you would log on u will remain on tournament page 
Great game Love it except some of the cars are too expensive but otherwise good
Addicting game This game is the best street racing game I've played. 100s of different cars and parts to tune them differently. Fun
