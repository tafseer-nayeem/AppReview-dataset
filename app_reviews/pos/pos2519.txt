Archery master 3 This game makes me wish I woulda tried archery earlier in life I fell 25 feet so I can't do this now but I so very wish I could I love this game
Awsome I like this game  alot because well it doesn't need internet for starters and the grafics are pretty good so I would recommend this game but it cost to much for the new items
Great game. Upgrades are acceptable, been playing for one day and I've already got the next bow without spending any money. Go back to every bonus round on a daily basis because they reset, easy way to get coins. Playing on an s5 not a tablet and I find aiming to be a challenge but not unplayable. Obviously not for everybody, if the game was too easy it would suck, imo.
Fun but they were clueless Fun game but the creators know nothing about archery and I'm pretty sure they didn't get the rights to the IQ Bowsight that they jacked for the picture. The stabilizers are car parts... bahahahaha. From the view point of an avid archer in real life this is hilarious
