Helped alot I used this app for 2 out of 3 12 of my pregnancies the 12 means I had a miscarriage at 10 week's 5 days '  . Was a great help. Thanks.
Hey chick who thinks its dumb, The first day of youre last period, is becuz you count the weeks from that to tell you how far you are obviously if you had youre period you werent pregnant, That how the Drs. Do it too.. so hopefully you booked a ob appointment. So they can help you understand it better.
Finally, a simple pregnancy tool I'd searched forever for something this basic to use during Antenatal Clinics...Thanks a million
Caculator Love it it tells u how much weeks and days you are and were pregant
