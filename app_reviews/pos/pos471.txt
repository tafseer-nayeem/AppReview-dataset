Use headphones It works Ignore the bad reviews the app works, phones vary but on my Samsung Note 4 we can hear the baby's heartbeat very good. I took the case off and put the phone on airplane mode and plugged a pair of cheap headphones in and we can pick up the heartbeat very well. Make sure you use headphones otherwise the mic will pickup the sound that the speaker is emitting and gives you the trolleys effect. My partner is only just 28 weeks. It will depend on how the baby is laying also.
Works great  It worked for me I know it's accurate because I just left my doctor's office, and my son's heart rate was the same on this app as it was at the doctor's office. I love that you can record the heartbeat my husband is in the Navy and hasn't been able to attend many appointments with me. Now, he can hear our son's heart beating whenever he wants. Love this app
LOVE THIS APP It's well worth the price to install fabulous app nice and easy and I definitely picked up babies heartbeat, and I'm only 9 weeks 
Mrs O I'm only 18 weeks and could detect faint heart beat.  this app is NHS recommended definitely a worth while pregnancy companion. Love this app
It works We tryed the app this evening. 32w today and ater eating in the evening the baby was very active, so we tryed the app. Within one minute we had the baby's pulse, it was a pretty high BPM of 175 as he was kicking constantly. Thank you for this great app. We had allot of fun using it this evening with the headphones on.
Cool Took some time to find heartbeat because I'm only 26 weeks and baby hadn't turned yet, but I was able to find heartbeat and make a clear recording to share plus it measured the bpm which was close to what doc had gotten on doppler a couple days before.  Takes patience to find correct spot and volume to hear clearly  but it definitely works.  I was able to do it first time I tried app.  I have S5 Active.
