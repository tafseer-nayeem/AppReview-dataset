Surprisingly addictive I downloaded this for gems on another game, but have deleted the other game. This one is better by far Challenging at times, monotonous, making pepperoni pizzas to a level three, but I love the cruises I wish they occurred more often.
Sweet game   Downloaded this game and so far its going well, i compete with my girlfriend and race to level up ...lol
Brilliant Definitely better than the first restaurant story, more to do actually get to harvest ya food in a way. Like that food doesn't ruin on this one. Overall great app.
Love it I love this game but its really hard to finish the things that are asked to receive anything and its too long of await for things we need to complete tasks and earn anything.. Please make it a lil easier and not so much to do at one time .it also cost way to much for everything
