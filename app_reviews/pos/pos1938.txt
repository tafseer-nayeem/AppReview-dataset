Thrive island Great game i like it alot the bears in the cave don't give me nothing though also looking forward to what he putting in this game to. He said he would update on the regular still waiting
Love it This game is brilliant, i tried the trial and love this now, only thing, apart from obsidian tools ive run out of stuff to so, more to build and hunt please, apso ive killed 50 bears and no skin
Brilliant Loving it, built a nice big 3 story Basehome with a bedroom and a crafting room on the top floor and just having fun exploring, more crafting recipes tho please Need more stuff to make
Wonderfully Done Played the free version then bought the full version. Absolutely love playing it. Noticed a few glitches such as floors,walls, etc disappearing after going to sleep or opening the game up after closing it. Also noticed that the hell hound only does about 2 damage with each hit as opposed to bears and wolves doing about 10 or so. Looking forward to many more improvements and additions to this game Will be buying the PC version first thing tomorrow.
