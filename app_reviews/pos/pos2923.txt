Fun take on a great episode My two year old daughter loves this show, and this is one of her favorite episodes. The app makes her laugh a lot, like when Daniel says all clean after his bath, or when he flies through the clouds during the Good Night song. Good stuff I think only a Snowflake Day app could top it.
Great for toddlers 2 year old absolutely loves this game.
Daniel tiger naoobhood My little sister loves playing this game
Quality App for my, 2yr old Very content with the content. My daughter never seems to tire of brushing his teeth, washing his hair, getting him dressed, or making his breakfast. Worth the money imo
so interactive my little one couldnt get enough of it
It won't download
My daughter loves it
Wonderful
Excellent My son loves  it
These people with bad reviews are insane... On both my Nexus 5 and Galaxy Tab this app is smooth as butter.  Furthermore, 2.99 for this amount of content IS crazy. It should cost 4.99 or more. It's extremely well designed, both for little fingers and young minds. If your child loves Daniel, buy this app and ignore these idiots.
No problems I have not had any issues with the game and my son loves it
And I'll explain why I bought this game through this Google play had it through many phones. I get my new note 3 the app won't re install and is saying I need to re.purchase. The only reason I re. Purchased it was because my daughter is addicted.
My son loves this app
Cats My cats constantly attack my phone when this gsme. Its hilarious
Great. Could have more for how expensive it is though.
Fantastic fun for routines Our nearly 2 year old loves both of Daniel's games. He even brushes his teeth while we help Daniel brush. This is definitely not a teaching app, but it is well worth the price.
