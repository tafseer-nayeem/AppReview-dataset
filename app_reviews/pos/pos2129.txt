Gin Rummy .....reminds me of Conquian,conquer, for the other gringos out there , good graphics, nice set up and a lot of fun...glad to see 1 game hasn't been ruined by pop up ads.... damned good work ya'll
SURPRISINGLY ADDICTIVE I was devoted to a previous developer's version of Gin Rummy but after upgrading to Note 4 it proved incompatible to my device. After shopping around in Play store, found this and which is far superior.  This developer should have a higher rating with all their hard work. For free , people, a few ads are a minor bother the game returns after deleting ad. In this game you even get to see the opponent's hand if you choose Excellent and MY thanks to the developer
Great opponents Not sure what easy peesy players the complainers beat in real life I love this game and all the levels of players. Can't consistently beat the top level player yet but I got Carters number and beat him fairly regularly. Hate the new ads tho. Banner was better only hated the ones that flashed and wished the were at the top not so close to the player's cards. But love it whatever they do.
Great rummy. Slick design  cards freely draggable and fanned out like real cards. Good AI. Customizable rules inc. undo and passing options. Don't know why people complain about ads. A project this good takes time and skill  the devs have to make a living.
