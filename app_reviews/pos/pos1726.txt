Worked very well I used it on two Europe trips, each trip included driving in several countries. A must have specially in Germany and Switzerland.  It performs great
Excellence Used it for years now, one of the best if not the best
It works Brilliant app,  works with truvelo cameras on the other side of the road too. Also works in the background mode so you can have your phone screen off and just have audio warning beeps.Also widget can overlay Google maps or navigator so use the best sat Nav with the best speed warning app. All for 99p
Great Hi guys and thankyou for the app it works great. How do you update the speed cameras though I get requested to do so often but cant figure out how to do it
Excellent Excellent, no problems running in background with maps and media monkey both on. Honor 6 phone.
Best 99p you will ever spend Brilliant app, alerts for 99 off cameras, very rarely misses camera. Do not delay, part with the 99p, you will not regret it
Does exactly what you expect it to do. The best spent 1 in my whole life Allows you to concentrate on the road and your driving rather than speed and cameras. Best app ever
So far so good Not bad at all. Maybe a generic English voice would be nice 
Fantastic but... can you please add some kind of emergency exit optione.g when turning off the display the widgetapp quits too or something like that because Such apps are not allowed in my  country. Long pressing on to the widget is taking too much time
