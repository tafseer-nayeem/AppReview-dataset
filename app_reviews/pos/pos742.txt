Hi, this is a nice app. However, will you be adding the new Darees Hafti as well as Ae Allah na Dai and also, it would be nice to have the Audio for Anasheedul Atfal. Thanks.
Alhamdollilah Superb nd complete solutuon for all prayer needs
Nice application ...thank you New update is very usefull.   With  namaz n wuzu with audio..etc
Best Apps , well organized and really useful apps
Very good now
Super App
MUST HAVE APP Afzalus salam bhai this App is very Good but it still needs few more changes like Munajaat which we recite daily in fajr namaaz is missing, Daris Hafti can be updated to new which has Ae Allah na dai and alam ma be dinillahe.. and most important please add a feature to add mutiple bookmarks  Shukran
Excellent needful resource at one place
A good start Has the necessary content. App design and some consistency elements need work. The Content looks a little squished. The Kitabs should launch in full screen mode. Good work, keep it up.
A great package.  Very useful and handy
Recomend everyone to download this ap
Very good

Very useful app Very useful for me as I am mostly on the go. Most of my daily deeni reading needs are met with this single app. Recommended
Liked the app. The moment i heard about it, i wanted to download it. And i was not disappointed The interface is nice and user friendly. Also this app has encouraged me to read duassurahs even while travelling. Shukran  and keep up the good work.
