Good Work I haven't used the app till now. It's downloading right now. But as per your website, you guys rock. Instant refund in case of failure is best and raising dispute with orders in case of difficulties is good also. Once I got messed up because I was trying to pay through Payumoney wallet and It was hell lot of time, so I canceled it and money got deducted and you guys refunded it after a dispute. Just great.
I wanted to refund my money from wallet to my account as i was not able to do so from the app. I mailed to their customer service team and they responded very quickly. They take business seriously and very professionally. It was nice to talk to that lady. She was polite and very helpful. Overall experience was good. I gained more faith in this app than any other in the market. Keep up the good work and all the best.
Nice EDIT for the rant below Got my monies back the same day. That was nice.  RANT Tried to pay using wallet balance and a Citi card. Got stuck loading after entering card details. So I cancelled the transaction. Yet the wallet balance was deducted. I didn't just want to PayU people money for nothing 
Nice app The app is well designed and easy to use. I found it better than Paytm and citrus.
