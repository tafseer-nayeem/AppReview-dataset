Woah... I don't get why people are leaving bad reviews. This Is by far the best mobile game I've ever played, easily surpassing the first. If you like the first thIs is much better, the combat is better, the interface is better, it just feels better too. Buy this game you will not be disappointed. Also the DLC is awesome.
So Clever and Funny I love how silly and cute this game is. I also love how it doesn't harp you for money. You just pay once, and that's it. You COULD buy extra coin, but there isn't really a need to, and it doesn't ask. I did buy the expansion. That was a fun campain. This game isn't too grindy, and not too fast. It's defiantly my money's worth.
My favourite game on mobile right now but i wish there could be pvplocal and also worldwide
Nostalgic fun It was like reliving old DD sessions on my phone. This game got me through a lengthy hospital stay.
Edit I originally gave this game 2 stars but it seems the game has been made better. No more push for microtransactions and the roll system is much better. Game is fun a good sequel to their Amazing first game.
Addictive and funny Dd style Great game funny punch lines and it keep me interested even after I finished the game great reply value
