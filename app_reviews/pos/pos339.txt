Best Devs Ever These guys took care of their loyal fans In my last rating I mentioned that it would be nice to have a way to get older limited units and with this update, they made one I had missed available again Will be enjoying this game twice as much now
I can't play anymore I don't know what happened but I updated it and it hasn't been right since . I don't want to have to reinstall it because I've already bought and made squads . It won't load or nothing . What do I need to do . Cause I need my slug back going
Great Best game to play to kill my boredom Although I would appreciate it if you fix the issue with the shop, every time I go to the shop, app kicks me out. Please fix.
