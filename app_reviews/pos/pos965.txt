Additional suggestion  1.In the Contacts, it should show the color of the sim at each number as well, so we can know which sim the number is kept. 2.In the Favorites,I cannot relocate the contacts. When I relocated the contacts, the contacts just disappear. Anyway, I love this app a lot. Thank you for fast response to my question.
Thanks What I needed My built in dialer app is lousy and this takes care of the deficits so thanks I have easy access to favorites now and can actually change the color of the dialer here and there for a little variety too. I also needed a dialer app that handles dual SIM and this does. I'm glad I came across it.
Just what I needed Upgraded to Android 5.1.1 and they screwed up the dial and contact apps, this app fixed there cockups and then some, runs perfect on xperia T2, bought it, bargain price, only 0.20 D
