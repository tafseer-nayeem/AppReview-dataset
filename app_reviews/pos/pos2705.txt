Krisypooh The best building gamed every it never get boring because when you run out of berries and shells there are still other games to play
Loved it Please install this wonderful app because this game is not bad at all. You must be silly person if you hate ice age games. So please rate 5 .
Happy for fixing My girlfriend and I would like yo play the game again but is there a way to restart the game. Thank you
Since the update the game glitches out to a black screen. This has happened several times when I travel on the turtle it restarted the game taking my berries I just paid to travel. Its also happened when saving an animal. I start down the slide and it just goes black then it restarts me back at the main island what's up  I play this game daily and love it Please fix it
