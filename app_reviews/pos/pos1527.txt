Not working anymore. Phone calls ring through but I can't hear anything. Default, method 1 no good. Method 2 doesn't block anything PLEASE FIX Samsung edge plus. Uninstalling paid version for now and seeking alternative. Will reinstall when fixed.
Awesomeness Now I have control of my Note 4 not Google or NSA.......I hope anyhow. I am willing to pay for the self satisfaction of this app. I do not have any problems with using my phone at all, not sure what others are commenting on with that issue as it is a complete non issue for me.
Mic Blocks Works
good had for yrs now
Purchased Works Great. I feel alil safer.
Great product Works perfectly
Paid version working better Able to install on phone and tablet with 1 pay. Better value. Appears the widget matches the notification temporary on time which is great. Now just tap widget, make voice search and forget about it.
Excelente aplicao Cumpre o que promete.
Wonderful Service Great app... developer got right on a Note 3 fix. Fantastic app very high quality and works perfectly.
Its terrible thats we need this... I glad 2 have this app..
Awesome tool and it works to have not had any problems
Loving It Loving this app so far. With the recent privacy changes to Facebook Messenger, I expect this app to be getting A LOT more downloads in the days and weeks to come as word spreads about this  My only suggestion would be to include a white list that we can whitelist certain apps,  Keep up the good work
Somthing you all need
Down like two flat tires Get this app. It's worth 2.69. If you have a smartphone. Its like having a desktop computer with you that's always connected to the internet.
