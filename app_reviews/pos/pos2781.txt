Helpful Love it. Helps my toddlers with  numbers and keeps them happily busy. However I'm not sure how I feel about the categories. The older version was full of surprises but with this version you can be sure of what will come up after a few games. My son keeps asking for cars etc when he gets bored with the animals. It would be nice if you fix this and add more numbers beyond 26.
My granddauthers love this, they are only 2 and 3 and will play  for hours if you let them. They are learning their numbers and what is behind the numbers
Works on galaxy xcover 2 Thanks for the fix. It's 5 stars now.
