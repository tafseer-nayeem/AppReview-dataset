Love this app. Great drills for keeping on your toes with hand reading and a lot of the mental math involved with equity and odds estimations. Ive been looking for a  poker studying app just like this for a while and finally found one The user interface is minimalistic to say the least, but who can complain when it costs a dollar and gets the job done. Looking forward to seeing more stuff from these guys.
best poker trainer app ever experienced This is the most usefull app for poker training because it focuses on the most important concepts that many people are not familiarized with...I strongly reccomend
