Spelling for children My daughter is 4 and now she knows to spell ELEPHANT. Thank you god. O
My little brother loves this game because it helps him spell
Its perfect My daughter just turned 4 and it was frustrating for my husband and i to help her read write and spell with only paper alone. We kno she is very advanced and has the mentality of an older child so when we tried this app she immediately loved it and all we hear all day is her spelling aloud. Thank you greatly for this easyer way to spell
