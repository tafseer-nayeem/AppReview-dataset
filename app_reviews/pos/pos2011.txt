Love this game Always fun to play other people from different parts of the world, along with buddies, too. Along with the new upgrades to the game, makes it even better to play more people. The game keeps getting better and better and a newer version even has more features Like some of the new features but miss the biggest winner. They continue to add more and more challenges to the states game which is an incentive to play it.
Family Time The app works great. Since I moved away from home my dad and I play this. It is are family time from afar. Has come to mean a lot to both of us. Only complaint is you have to accept the rewards. Seems silly to me. Guess I'm just lazy.
If you have ever played Yahtzee, this is the same game but with a bonus ... literally. You are offered bonus roles for free and that often means taking a 5 of a kind instead of triple sixes. Tons of fun, fast paced and you can play multiple games at once to avoid Waiting on a slow opponent. You'll have fun.
Great game To everyone who can't claim their scratchers, click the three dots in top right corner and select scratchers
AWESOME GAME The BEST App GAME to play between 2 people, on your cell or tablet. BOTH OF YOU GET ADDICTED, calling each other saying when are you playing next. Do things to get extra rolls. You can even CHAT while playing If your on Facebook you ply with ALL your FB Friends too.
