Without doubt, download this game From one racing game expert to the other, hands down, the best swipe racer out there...will be anxiously waiting on a sequel
New F1 mobile game Guys can you make a new F1 mobile game this one was really awesome and I would recommend you make a new one more better than before
Really fun Good way to kill time, controls are a bit tricky at first but you get used to them pretty quick Only thing is I'd love for the carsdrivers to be updated for the current season but I doubt that'll happen
One of the best Game is well thought thru. I really enjoy this game and I think others will too. It's different. It's difficult but once you get used to it,  it's a whole Lotta fun. I actually prefer this game over many of the NASCAR games. Don't even watch indy car racing but the game is in a word is excellent.
Simple but effective Not on the same level as the F1 series of games on XboxPS3, but as a fairly simple game designed for mobile devices it's great. The steering system isn't the most intuitive, but once you work it out handy hint, keep your finger on the track it's a great way to fill in a bit of time whilst also providing a reasonable challenge to play through.
Update please  I would absolutely love it if you could update the game to the current f1 season , I want Kimi with ferrari, PLEASE FIX STEERING CONTROLS , I CAN'T TURN LEFT
