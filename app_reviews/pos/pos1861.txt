A professional review This game is a good representative of what mobile games should be. It's fun and packed with adventures for players to dwell through anywhere and anytime. Though, a few additions could make this game even better than the PC version. Here is a list of what I think could perfect the mobile version Friends list, more islands, more purchase able items, costumes and special effects, profilecharacter page, more social areas and better inventory management.
I loved it so much fun I say soooooo much fuuuuuuuuunnnnnnnn SUPER STAR is my name in poptropica ya know y cause I'm the best and I'm a SUPER STAR.Yyaay for poptropica it is the best game I ever played and it is so adventurous and has so many Islands to play in I loovved the Timmy Failure and the Diary of a wimpy kid one.When I don't know how to get the island medallion I just go to YOUTUBE and type poptropica and there are many walkthrouhs and you can see CAPTON THINKNOODLES.
Mhmm Please add more islands I'm begging game makers please This game is so fun on my phone and easy to use so glad I found this is because I enjoyed playing it on my laptop but sadly it broke. Please Thank you
