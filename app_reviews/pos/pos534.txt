Finally it's almost as useful as the site This latest update is great. Moved that annoying lower ad bar and the stats gives you opponent strength like iOS. Been waiting for these options for a while
SERIOUSLY Good Update SERIOUSLY though the app finally has a nice clean layout. Finally getting feature rich. Still can be better. Trade evaluation within app is biggest piece missing. Do wish it was MORE obvious when your players have the ball.
6 stars if I could I have given many different ratings and comments and now... thank you for shutting me up Love the new format lay out stats and color rankings You have out done yourself and more than earned my 6 star rating. Thank you Yahoo this is awesome and keep up the good work for the seasons to come. Give those programmers a raise and a holiday bonus
Free agent list Please fix free agent list them in order of offense rank and not most added . I hate searching and searching for a player that's ranked high and all low ranked players are all mixed in.
Wonderful Love it Even tho i slacked this year
Helpful advice. Had problems with app, they responded with helpful advice and everything is working great
Great but could still improve. I like many of the updates but I don't like using the player search feature. It's too hard to sort by the stats I want to see.
A lot of great improvements So many improvements and updates this year. This is by far the best fantasy sports app. If at all possible I'd like to see my trophies in the app and the ability to share pics in the chat rooms. But that would just be icing on the cake.
Great app for all sports Reliable for up to the minute stats on all my favorite sports and teams. Absolutely live this App
