Excellent game, there's another classic slot game that was popular called shamrock 7's, it'd probably be as big of hit as this one
Great Love it

Love it I love this game. However, I wish it had a hold button so that you could hold on it like the ones that are in truck stops. It is awesome with the hold button.
Cherry Master slots Great game. Been looking for it a long time.
excellent great been looking for this game
Can't lose. Just like the ones at the bar. Except I keep winning. Kinda wish the odds were more realistic. Also wish there was a hold button to be able to get bells  1bars more often.
Bar games AWESOME,  I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS GAME SO I CAN STOP WAISTING MY MONEY IN THOSE CHERRY MASTER GAMES AT THE BAR  THANKS YOU JUST SAVED ME A BUNCH OF MONEY  IT WOULD BE COOL IF YOU COULD USE PAYPAL TO REALLY BUY CREDITS AND CASH THEM IN WHEN YOU WERE DONE PLAYING

Odds Please make it have last 3 times o n cherries and last 3 times on bells for bonus spins and also the option hold 1 line would be awesome
Saweet Just like the upright arcade cabinet versions All to easy to smack this slot when you dont use your own  50K credits so far and counting Payouts with paypal would be nice
I love to dubble up. I like the challange.
