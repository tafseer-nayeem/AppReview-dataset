Great for the right age range My 17 month old loves picking from the letters. My sister used this with her 2 children as well and they really enjoyed it. This is a great app for kids who are brand new to letters and sounds. 1830 months is probably the sweet spot. After that I plan on trying something a little more advanced like endless ABC.
Works great The game works great on my Nexus 7 and my Nexus 4. My kids love it My only complaint is that it doesn't take advantage of Kitkat's immersive mode to hide the system buttons while the kids are playing. Because of this, I have to sit with them to make sure they don't hit one of these buttons by mistake. Once this is fixed, it will be perfect
Love it Great for kids. My 19 month old lives it too
Awesome My kids love this app I love that it's educationally.
