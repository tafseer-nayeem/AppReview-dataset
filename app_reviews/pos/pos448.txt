Great I've been tracking sightings for years in a clumsy but still gratifying way. This app allows me to track, learn, and share in a quick and easy way. I absolutely LOVE it
Audubon Birds  identification app. Great app. Works great, helped identify two different types of owl in my back yard. I volunteer with scouts and have used it to identify random birds migrating through our camping areas.
Awesome App Disregard bad ratings. Those people are imbeciles. Shame on people complaining and blaming others for their own incompetence.  Judge the app for its functional value, not because you can't figure out your email spam filters. If there's a bug, notify them like an adult and not a crybaby.  The Audubon Society has my total respect and gratitude for their historical contributions to our country's natural environment...they deserve yours too Never heard of them Learn
Great in the field or at home This is still the only app I have ever paid for, and that was 2 years ago Log in on my tablet or my phone and all my notes and lists are current. I still carry two paper books everywhere, but this is how I find out what is in town.
Works thank you customer service Asked for help had the answer next day works perfect 
Audubon bird guide mobile Good photos, info, and vocalizations of birds. Bought when it became free.
I use it to ID bird calls when I'm in the field. Sometimes it takes some time because I can't see the bird that's calling, but the app is comprehensive with multiple calls for each bird, so I always have a good idea of what to expect. And for the price free, you can't beat it Using a Sony Z3 Company on Lollipop 5.1.1, I haven't had any of the problems that other reviews have mentioned.
Excellent Works without  Internet  access . This app have the birds songs and many pictures.
Only one issue. I did not get a confirmation email. I've checked my spam folder too and never got an email.
