Good Please provide route change  train in opposite direction. Sound can be increased.  Best one. Thanks. Please provide some additional routes which can be unlocked after saving some point. Really enjoyed very much. You deserve great appreciation. Thanks again. Updates are good. But sound is missing. Speed doesn't go beyond 80  suddenly sound is not coming. Check up.  Completed, any possibility of updates
Very nice I am happy...this game is very nice...pls try to come up with more plana and features and more maps
A Good one... Amongst the train games they gave a better trail. I had tried all levels.. But high score cannot be shared with other online players... But a good one for relaxation.... Highly addiction chances be aware...beware of addiction...a very good one
More tracks please Loving this game. However please increase the variety of terrains. Indian jungle terrain, ChineseTibetan terrain, ScandinavianRussian snowy terrain, African forest terrain etc.
Great detail For a free game I was expecting terrible, glitchy graphics, but this game is gorgeous It also runs very smoothly.
To many ads comes up when u are playing it and when you go to snow down the train u hit oneoff the ads and it goes off the game play fix it
TRAIN DRIVER 15 My phone maybe slowly because not upgrade yet...so open this game very long to playing. But I very loved....
