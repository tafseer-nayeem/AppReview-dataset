Best car game Best game on my tab. It works just fine, and for 49cents its a steal
Great Job You fixed it Thank you for fixing this game Using Asus Nexus 7, no more echo voices or music Works great, great fps, sorry for being angry earlier, I've purchased NFS Shift and Hot Pursuit, the latter specifically for the day I was to get my new tablet. I'll wait patiently for the New NFS, now that I have Pursuit  Thanks again, Great Job EA
