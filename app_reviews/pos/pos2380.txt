Stop Being Mean There trying there best there's so much a phone can handle why do you think there coimg out with all these new phones. I like the game and u should be thankful that they even put a Sims on Phone they could have just said forget it now did u think about that. Just know that there trying there vest And if free play is better why didn't you get it YouTube would have compared
Amazing This game is AWESOME I don't see why people hate it I mean it works If it doesn't work on their phone I guess their phone has a problem 
I love sims im a I really like The Sims 3 it's one of my favorite games but its not as good as the other ones on TV or YouTube
