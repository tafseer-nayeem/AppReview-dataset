More birds and golden pig hunt Good and a fun game .I think rovio must add more birds. It will help to defeat the enemies. And the golden pig hunt gives more than one lucky coins. And can use 3 birds in chronicle cave
Upped from 3 to 5 stars I edited my review because they fixed the problems i was having with the game.  Lots of fun again, love it
Loving it soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much I LOVE IT SOOOOOOOO MUCH SO I CAN SAVE ALL THE BIRDS AND DESTROY ALL THE PIGS THAT TAKE ALL THE ANGRY BIRDS AND GIVE THEM RANGE POWERS AND SUPER POWERS
I love it Its awesome I love how the makers are making new and awesome angry birds games and this one I think is the best I played maybe its because its a RPG and I love RPGs but still I love the new angry bird generation
I love this game aside from angry birds star wars 2 this is the best rovio game i have ever played. rpg's are awesome and an angry birds rpg is awesome. it also has a great challengem deserves 5 stars
