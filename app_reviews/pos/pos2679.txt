It's great Why so many bad ratings First of all,this is my first NFS game. A friend told me about it that he played it on his Xbox. 2cnd. For my bdy,I got this game and it worked fine Best game of all.
Really People keep complaining about money back on 10 cent if you use Google play rewards it really is not that bad plus you have 2 hour refund.
Works fine Ive had this game for less than ten minutes and it works fine... People complain that it don't work...and they want their money back. Come on, don't be so mad It's only ten cents...

This game is Great I love it and the graphics are amazing. I play this game on my phone more than I play this on my Xbox 360. I love playing games on my phone more than my game system, for one the games cost less and you don't have to worry about the disc getting scratched. I will recommend to everyone who wants this
Good Game It's really cool and vivid. but why my desktop icon is fuzzy Anyone has the situation with me
This game works People who are complaining it doesn't work its cause your phone might be pretty bad. And it DOES NOT take 15 mins to download it when you first launch it. It takes more like a minute.   And it's actually a really fun game but nothing like the console version or psvita version.
Really good I really like this game, I got it on a console as well. It's really fun to play, although it's not exactly like the console version and it doesn't have free drive, its still fun.
