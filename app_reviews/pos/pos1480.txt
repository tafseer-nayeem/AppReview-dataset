had to reyurn tried to use nextplis,,,,,but app was hanging,,,,and not  working right,,,,dont have all day to get messages working,,,,textplus still works great
My Favorite Messaging App Easy to use on my phone and tablet.
Great having problem with network, Having a problem with the network connection, says not connecting 
Please stop showing stupid ad Please stop showing stupid ad for the godawful new version that is 100 TERRIBLE Especially after I specifically PAID for NO ADS A deal is a deal If you discontinue this version, I'm LEAVING and not looking back. The new version is a spammy mess that completely RUINS a perfectly working product Sell the company back to the other guys or someone that can make IMPROVEMENTS, not DOWNGRADES
Tried Next Plus This is actually better than their new Next Plus in that it does not slow my phone down at all.
 I use this with my PC and it's awesome for texting.
Text is good It's the best free texting app in the android store. I love it very much
Annoying Remove the N logo for the new version, we paid for no ads
Awsome Works great good sound quality and texting is instant
