It's a great app The only thing is... To be able pick enchanting books , change XP levels and  ocelot spawn eggs 
AMAZING BUT CAN YOU PLZ ADD CUSTOM ENCHANT SO I CAN MYSELF SOMETHING LIKE A KNOCKBACK 100 STICK
Very good app but You didnt add the ocelot spawn egg other than that its a 55
Best MCPE Editing App This is the easiest to use editing app I have found.  The inventory editing tool is really the best  PLEASE update it for 13
Can you please add... The option of getting all 0.13.0 items and be able to pick enchantments for your toolsarmerand increasedecrease your hungerexperience barthat would be great
Helpful tool Some worlds take about 2 minutes to load but other than that fantasticlt728586888hjegikcks

Excellent 0.12.0 Support You can import schematics like from anywhere Including PC ones, but make sure that they don't have any blocks that mcpe doesn't have.
Gucci Its fire af like my mixtape yall should add all the enchanted books and potions
Works As Promised So I bought this app a few weeks ago and all I can say is that it is worth the money. You can do a lot of amazing things with this app like change your inventory and what mobs are in that world. This is indeed the best editor for Pocket Edition.
Awesome Works great It would be perfect if it could install texture packsmods.
Pls add stuff for the 0.13.0 update for Minecraft but it works great
Great app But no ocolot spawn eggs
