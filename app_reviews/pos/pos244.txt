I effin needed this I've watched several anime movies and seasons I wouldn't have otherwise come across. Great movies and t.v. shows. Excellent app. Only thing I would say needs improvement is having to clear the data and restart the app every couple episodes but still worth the 5 star rating.
Always been a good keeper Have had this app off an on for a few years and I must say it gets better and better, keep up the good work and thank you for the years of free shows and movies, its ment alot
Great app Love it. Many adds but it works fine. And don't let me start about original series Great Mansion, wonderful smart clever stop motion series. Keep the good work guys
I love it. One of the best apps I've downloaded so far. I love watching the older shows and the movies on here. This app is great.... So I give y'all guys and gals 5 stars...
Cool It's cool I was reading this book and my friends said there was a movie so I downloaded this and the movie was great
