Fantastic. Just plain awesome basically the same thing as Facebook but better because there are no stupid notifications, you can still chat with friends, and it takes up practically no space on my phone. Thanks Guys.
Great Didn't know they have this app. Been using IG for a long time, and this helped a lot. I enjoyed using IG more 
Love it Cool, easy to use I simply LOVE this app  It's very cool, and easy to use I highly recommend it I take hundreds of photos a day,  would recommend to anyone looking for a very simple, quality, collage app
Sami Ali Great... it's really good app but 2 options are missing the first is the delete option and the second is the rotating.
This is pretty good because you can share with your friends pictures I like this one it is pretty good for sharing pictures with friends
I  IT Let's me do a collage without having to use pics art. Nice
