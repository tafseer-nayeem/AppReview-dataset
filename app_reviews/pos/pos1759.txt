Just what i need Way better than the official Gautrain app which i logged tons of calls on and i got a very defensive response about their app when i tried to explain the glitches i was experincing . I like the trip memory capability, i dont have to always select start and end station coz i frequent a couple of different areas 
Awesome Actually better that the 'official' app. Accurate and fast. Great user interface. And FREE Thanks for a super effort guys
Brilliant Awww bruv, this all sorts of legit. Good job, perhaps y'all could go help out the guys at Computicket
Gold Cannot go without it
Exaxtly what i need as a first time user
Impressive
I am telling you the countdown is awesome for a busy lady like me...thanx.
Awesome Thank you for creating such a beautiful app. It's very refreshing to see devs making such  awesome apps.
Nicer than the official app
Incredibly useful The lack of this app was what kept me from using the Gautrain more often...
Precise, and a very efficient app.
Great App, better than the official app.
An Agrade app.
Perfect Really helpful Clean design.  Works well
Awesome app. Like the trip planner
Great app Without doubt the best Gautrain app. Unfortunately the bus routes are not shown on the map anymore since the latest update.  I like the new pins for the bus stops though.
