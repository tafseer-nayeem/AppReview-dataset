Supply and demand Needed new pair of h.phones like asap. Like that, they were in my hands. Hella Instant gratification. Loving it.
Pretty decent. I checked this out,  I like it
Well.. Its not the Apps fault.. I havent sold anything but I dont blame the app for that. There are many buyers and sellers and it has a great set up. If i posted something worth buying then i would probably get some buyers.
Love it But it does not let me search for stuff
