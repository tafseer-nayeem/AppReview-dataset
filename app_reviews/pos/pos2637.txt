Word buzz
Awesome Love the game. Don't know if it's possible to have it on account rather than starting from scratch if using a different phone. I started over anyway, because I'm somewhat addicted
Word Buzz It's definitely the next Buzz in word games. Too much fun. It challenges your brain, but makes thinking fun
Intelligent, challenging game Lots more to it than mindless matching games or word searches. Good variety.
New comment developer Thanks for the prompt response. Guess I'll just keep an eye on it and any others CM keeps wanting me to Hibernate. Can still use them, just do not impact my phone's performance as heavily. Isn't all this stuff kept in the Cloud these days though The mind boggles at the amount of resources occupied to run games this way, wow.
