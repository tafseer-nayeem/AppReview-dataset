Great Have been playing this app for 4 years now, still very fun. John has updated with features I have requested like cut throat which is awesome. I have found that pitch's AI is a little flawed but still very enjoyable. Only wish you could play 2 player cut throat.
Love playing, even if the computer players are not too sophisticated There's some brute force logic in the AI, it seems, but just being able to play this game again is still loads of fun.
Pitch We played 10 point and call for your partner at home with friends and family . My Grandma Nellie taught me well. I love this game, no other version comes close. I want it on my Kindle Fire, PLEASE  Homergirl
Perfect There's many different ways to play, so if you change the rules to what you're used to, it's perfect
Love it Amazing fun and good prac
4 Point Cutthroat John, this is great especially now that you have cut throat version. This is how I learned to play as a boy in Western Nebraska.  THANKS   Mike McV.
Last update was great New look is much better. Al seems more consistent. Nice  Update July 2014 release with new cutthroat option really makes this game great.
Good customization for variations Very true to the way we play pitch in the midwest.  Allows several different variations of rules to mix it up too.  App works in landscape and portrait  Wonderful app  Can't wait for the two player version
