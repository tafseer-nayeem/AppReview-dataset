Had some problems but they were fixed quickly and completely.  So I'm back to this being a big favorite  Doesn't hold you up for 2 or 3 days between levels as other games do. Some levels are tough now that I'm over level 400 but still fun
Love this game Its really good fun to play but could do with more than five lives as I find myself playing it so much that 5 lives arent enough I either have to pay for more or wait 20mins for the next life to come up All over awesome game and worth a download
It's got a change of pace since the last time I played this game but it is still the same thing as before still have to say give it a try
Took over Candy Crush Started playing this game over a year waiting for more lives on Candy Crush and I got hooked...I never did go back to playing Candy Crush.
Cookie Jam Good job I like playing this as I was well over level 100 then one day I was back on level one. Who knows what happened
So fun Really fun game. Been playing for a few days and haven't had to bug anything yet, love it.
Fun This game is fun and addictive. I play it every day. The graphics are very nice, too. I don't have any problems with this game at all, and hopefully it stays that way lol. Great game 
Awesome game Tried others but this is best by far cute fun to play really like it
