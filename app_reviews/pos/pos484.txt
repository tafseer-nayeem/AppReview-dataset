Very intuitive design, great themes, and the fact you can use this app with many different services... simultaneously if you wish, make it the Swiss army knife of news readers. I'm currently using it with Inoreader and Tiny Tiny RSS... and an added bonus is the Google News interface. Highly recommended.
Love this It just keeps getting better. I get up to the minute news on any specific subject. Nice adjustments for reading comfort.
Just what I needed I was happy to upgrade to the premium version of this app. News is the news reader I've been looking for It has a nice intuitive interface and synchs reliably with Feedly.
Happy User, More Happy With Material Design update. Really nice RSSNews Reader.  Reasonably priced for the quality app for the quality it  delivers, IMHO.  As such, I am always looking for a new app or method or keeping up on my RSS feeds and on other news.  News is a good way to tame the volume.  My RSS feeds display well, sync quickly via Feedly, and the Google News sources open up another source for information.
Finally Found a Good News App I have been trying them all until I found this one.  It does all that I want, easily, and it is fast
Extremely useful Read aloud functionality is my favorite feature. Wish it could be controlled by media buttons though
Still Excellent Just keeps getting better...  If I could have one request,  it would be syncing feeds between devices.  Beyond that,  it's perfect.
Best news reader, glad to support it.
Can we get an update Good butSeems like this hasn't been updated in a while while the greader is always getting new updates
Like it Though it's in the costlier side but omits worth it.
Good app Would like to request for don't colour of widgets to be selectable i.e. black instead of white. This would be nice when using the white background. Thank you
Perfect The best option for read feeds in android. If you use tiny tiny rss, here's the best client.
