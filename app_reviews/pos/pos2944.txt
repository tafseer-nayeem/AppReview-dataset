It's awesome This is what I've been waiting for now when I play with my wrestlers I don't have to go online for the entrance music I just have to go on this app
Its the best if you can add more superstars to it please add them in you next update, please i request you mattel
It's Fantastic I loved it because john cena is my favourite wrestler and I like wwe but when I go into super it is asking internet connection  when i opened internet  and I choosed john cena it is not going to play because play is filled with black colour and not with red 'PLEASE FIX IT NOW PLEASE'
Good but....... I wish you can put your videos in the entrance
I looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove u it is the best game ever played wwe rocks
Love it This app is my new favorite app because I only watch wwe on tv
Good game This game or app what ever it is called helps alot when me play wwe
Great music but I want more players like Jack swagger etc.
Possible future sync It would be cool if you could like the creation studio load a titantron for a caw without using a default wrestlers video. 2K should consider this.
This game ls cool Little slow at first but then its just fine i hope they fix this
Hang Please check your wwe entrance it is not coming so make is fast
Not responding when I click on superstars,entrance,camera plz tell me quick what to do or I uninstall it.
Cool Omg so sweet
