I have been playing this for quite some time and still love it. I agree with the others, it does get pricey to buy upgrades. It would be ok if you could win more gems in the casino.
Addicting I've always been addicted to time management games, even on PC.. This one topped it on an android platform Wish that upgrading doesn't juices the player out though..
I'm addicted and have Completed all levels ... now just waiting for the update so new levels will open up .... hurry up .... im waiting. .. lmao ............ updated yesterday but no new levels to do ... still waiting to play .... not happy now ......
THE BEST I thought it was gonna be hard but NO it is so easy and fun I love it and if any people hate it then...wow U are crazy
Great game but... Fun to play, well put together and face paced. Only negative, is how many gems It Takes To Buy upgrades And the different restaurants.
I love the game I have my mom and daughter playing but it does freeze up on me sometimes then customers leave please fix
