A dark room It's the same as the free dark room app but improved with a dark screen and ability to see the message log.
Best Game Really liking the new text sizing and control for expanding notifications. Works better than the old taptoexpand.
great game love this game. i had an issue with the text overlapping and it was fixed pretty quick
Fun A little buggy but a lot of fun
Cool My only complaint had already been fixed. I just needed to update. Works great. No issues now.
Fix the I am addicted to this game  My only complaint is that when I go out to explore the world whenever I press the directional pad it always clicks the action log and I keep having to minimize it and then be really careful when clicking the directional pad. Maybe it's just me though
Awesome
Mem
FAN FREAKING TASTIC This is a fantastic game. Its fun and minimalistic, with a deep underlining story that has you guessing and discovering through the whole game.
I'm loving it, but for some odd reason all of my meat is disappearing it has been doing it for 2 weeks now. I can't do anything when I don't have any meat, I have all of the thing to get the meat. This app making me mad.
Ok it was awesome but ..... I want to be able to scroll through the text often times 3 sentences appeared and part of it was cut off other than that ten out of ten
Cool Had fun..finished it in 2days though..I was hoping when I rode that starship I'd be transported to another place haha..please make more.
