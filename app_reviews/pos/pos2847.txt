Sooooo nice The new update was super nice But the Way too Wonderland section was not compatible with my tablet, which is pretty unfair. It should be good for ALL gadgets that download this game. And there are limited ways to collect charms. And most stuff are locked, and you need to buy them. There should be more things like accesories, characters, colors and more. It should not be THAT costy. But overall, this game is AMAZING for my opinion
I love ever after high and the characters of ever after high and My most favourite character is Raven Queen the good version of the Evil Queen and I love her streaks and in Disney's descendants are just like Mal and sorry I'm comparing Eah to auradon prep's characters. This app is perfect even though I have to pay for those stuff. I really  love playing the game
Ever After High Great game and videos, but hopefully you will update them, also I'm a bid Ever After High fan so this helps. 
Ever after high I love it because  you get to watch episodes of  ever after  high
Ever after high It is the best game I have ever had
You gotta love it I love  ever after  high its one of my fav shows and this is the perfect game for me to watch the show and play some games based on it
It's really good Great app
