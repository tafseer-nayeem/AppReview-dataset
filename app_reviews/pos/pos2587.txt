Deal with the hackers I've met many hackers, I just deal with it, I don't even care The developers don't have the time to ban hackers one by one, if they banned constantly there would not be an update for 5, 6, 8 months or maybe a year without updates Just deal with it JUST DEAL WITH IT
How do you get the spy thing i dont know How everybody has it but me this kid has it and hes not even close to my level its wierd
Totally worth it Love this game Paid DL here, rarely have issues. Even hackers can't match you if you're good, I've beat many, they get mad and rage quit lol
It's so addictive You should add a gorilla that can jump on Bloons or even melee them
Hackers matched with Hackers.. If you're a hacker even if it's just medallions and energy, then you're more likely to be paied up with a hacker but if you don't even hack then you're going to find hackers but very rarely.
Hacker I was facing a hacker and won. Lives hacker.  He used to have 150 and on round 46 he had 881 lives. 1 brutal flying behemoth got past and a m.o.a.b got past and lost even though he had more that 10 summon p h e n o i  x. And 10 tempest tornado. Also 3 support chain hook. Maybe put a hacker button to avoid it.
I love this game very much but plz deal with hackers I hate lossing against them It isn't fair u know I've paid alot for this game but pretty good game though
PLEASE MARK THIS AS HELPFUL ive played this game since it was out and I've only met 1 hacker. He could put monkey pirate ships on land. I know it wasn't lag because there was no water. BUT ONLY 1 HACKER. seriously stop complaining. mark this as helpful so everyone can see it.
UPDATE Your new update has ruined a perfect game and has lost so many peoples interest in it very disappointed
Awsome Awsome but can you make it so you almost matched with your appointment because I played a  battle against a guy with 3245 battle score when I had 42 please do it
