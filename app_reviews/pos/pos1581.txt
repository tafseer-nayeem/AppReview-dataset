One of the best Twitter clients I've tried many Twitter clients over the years but I still come back to using this withing a few days. The paid version has been worth it. The only thing that still needs improvement is push notifications. Official client does it better all the time. Otherwise, I've no complaints.
The latest update Seems to have fixed the issues with tweets talking several minutes to send when you have a solid data connection. Still my favourite twitter app  worth the premium upgrade.
After a few updates, this is the best Twitter App I've used I currently own a Galaxy Note 3 and this is a great app to go with the phone. The only thing that it's missing is PocketInstapaper support.
BEST TWITTER APP No doubt the best twitter app out. I've tried them all. There's absolutely no other app that handles multiple accounts as gracefully. It has the best widgets. It also has the highest level of customization. So good, I bought the ad free version.
Best 3rd party twitter client I've tried a lot of 3rd party clients for Twitter since an official app became too intrusive in private information. And this one is apparently the best for my needs.
