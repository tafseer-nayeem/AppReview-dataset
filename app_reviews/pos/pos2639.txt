I got to a really far level, almost 1600 and when you get there you have to download more levels. I been doing that a few times now but this last time, after i download even after it says complete I'll hit the play button and it will keep saying i need to download it still...idk what to do
Need More Levels I am stuck at level 3300 and have been for months.  Will this game ever go to a higher level or not  I really love the game but, it's going nowhere...
Brain teaser  Could be a lot more fun if there wasn't so many adds so close together. Good for killing time and keeping the mind sharp.
Four pics one word Great fun whilst waiting for trains etc although some of the words are quite hard to guess due to it being American and having different words but it gives you hints and is good workout for the brain cells
Not a bad way to waste some time Not a bad way to waste  little  time. although sometimes it does make you feel pretty stupid
Hooked Great game so far, some are pretty easy then again some get pretty difficult, so it keeps me interested  it's not too much of either where it makes me just want to quit 
When are there more levels coming. I have been maxed out for over 3 months. The daily quiz keeps me interested but I need more levels to challenge myself.
Entertaining Good way of passing the time, if I get stuck I prefer to leave it. I will either guess it next time or a letter will appear.
Good mind wake up. Helps me shake the cobwebs when I start my day. Had it on a earlier phone, but my score coins did not transfer. Thankfully, it is only a word scramble. Nothing special being lost.
I really do love this game But once you get to a certain level it goes completely out and I have to uninstall it and reinstall it again to start over
Awesome Love this game its really fun I'm super addicted. Though I had to uninstall it couple times cause I was stuck and couldn't figure out the word cause at times the pics don't make sense
