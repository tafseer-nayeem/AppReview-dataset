Great postapocalyspe rpg  20  hrs of game storyline with the side quests, multiple moral choices and character classes making this game fun to replay, price is reasonable for how much you play. I wish i could have played it on my tablet and phone through a google play type of save function. It's a bit difficult to read the text on a phone.
Fix this game Crashes over and over, then I'm back to my last saved game repeatedly.  Stuck zoomed in, can't zoom out. Ridiculously long loading time. Hard to get any real gameplay accomplished like that. Please please please fix these problems. Other than all that, cool game.
Amazing Story was great, charters were great, many hours of gameplay. Long loading times and lag were common place toward the end game, didn't ruin experience since it's turn based. Played on galaxy s5. I had no problem seeing and reading everything, definitely recommend
Fantastic Like playing a novel... Great game, cracking storyline, fabulous characters. Yes, the load times can be long lack of zoom isn't great and the screen sometimes darkens when you move during combat so you can't see the enemy all annoying. But overall an awesome RPG for your phone that you won't regret buying.
Awesome game Great story And love the visuals. Slight slow downs and problems double tapping to use attacks do hamper the overall game play.
