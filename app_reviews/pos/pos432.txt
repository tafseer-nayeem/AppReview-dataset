5 stars for discounts and flexibility of orders They have limited options but great diacounts........Had a couple of bad experiences, gave the feedback but got no reply, beleive they just want business, which everyone else is doing, anyways kudos to discounts
App is much improved, they listen Bcoz panda30 does not work anymore so Today was a day of zero discount from app, but I still ordered bcoz they heard to all my requests n suggestions, 2 vendors I have tried have done a gr8 job with quality, hope pizzahut comes up with online payments  their coupons can b used here also, waiting for the best
A friend of the laziest The reason I never went hungry even though I know jack about cooking.
