Rating  5 star Only if Indians could show solidarity during the scams and far more serious political issues than what a celebrity feels about the country.

About Aamir khan I identify with aamir, cause I am not stupid and judgemental . He spoke facts . Sd, these are ppl just showing off, keep ur cool n continue with the good work . 
It's a super deal I download it because some misguided persons of my country are trying it to down rate with no logic. About App it is really working very good and its functionality and offers are interesting and needful.
Stop Uninstalling Snapdeal App People are showing their anger with Amir Khan comment on Intolerance by targeting A Indian Startup company who is really doing fantastic job to make our Indian rural business together and giving them a good platform to sell their products in effective manner. You guys are uninstalling snapdeal app so why are you not removing your Samsung phone because that also endorse by Amir. So make sense and don't show your anger for unnecessary event in useless manner
