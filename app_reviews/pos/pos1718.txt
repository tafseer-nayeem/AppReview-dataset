It does not work super well wuth the Samsung galaxy but the show is so outstanding,  it's worth putting up with the kinks.  I would probably use the app more if it worked better.
Podcasts for the road This app has been a savior for my 2 hour commute to a new job.  Such great content.  Stories to make you think, feel and laugh.  Highly recommended.
Love this but... I just got bluetooth headphones to wear while I listen at work, and the app stopped working the way it used to with normal plugin headphones. It will play while my screen is on, but the time lapse bar will not work and when my screen turns off, the app shuts down. Very disappointing
It's got some quirks, sometimes loses your place in the track after pausing but I stl love being able to get all this stuff for such a tiny price. Add a donate button
Great app, wonderful program This American Life is like having the best one sided conversation ever.  Ever week I tune in excited to hear what we will be talking about this week.  I replay my favorites on the app like some listen to their favorite songs.
Great app, some bugs One of the best investments I've ever made with my smartphone, though the app does get stuck from time to time.
