New interface looks promising.  I will combine this with my Synology Cloud Sync.  Chrome, Linux, Android.  The concept is really nice.  It's a combination from file explorer and note taking.  I will be comparing with Synology Note Station, cross platform too but this is a whole new perspective.  Hope I get used to it...
