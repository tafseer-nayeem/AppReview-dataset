Great game but the computer cheats. Yes its true that playing other people they came wait days to make a move.
Great turnbyturn play Having a lot of fun playing with folks via my phone.  Support was quick to help with a login problem that I had.
Easy and fun Super easy to use, never crashes. The messaging is the only lag on the game. Nice work
Family Fun I'm playing against my family. We all got hooked. It's basic but entertaining.
Luv the game Just wish they add skunks 75 0 which would cost 2 lost not 1, and
Good Suff The new upgrade took care of a couple of things that were distractions. Still a great game.
New ways to play Like most people, I learned how to play and usually play by fives, but now I'm addicted to both BLOCK  DRAW. Thanks for putting some new spins new to me on one of my alltime favorite games
To Flyclops and Robby To flyclops You are welcome, ive download a few domino games ans none of them compares to this one, Thank you.   To Robby, I found that if you open up to many games at one time the ads automatically cover the dominoes. Make sure when you get into the game that there's only one game being played, if it shows your playing two games delete one. Try that it may work for you.
Love it I can challenge the computer and learn. And I can play friends or strangers and have fun and maybe just learn a thing or two
Dominoes We love it, I play all my favorite  contacts, even people I don't know. Whenever I have a free moment Im playing my turn.  I rarely ever download or play games on my phone, but this one is addictive....who wants an addiction
Great game only thing I would say is make the playing time shorter for the person you are playing against.
