My go to By far my favorite face, set the face to 75 brightness and it goes and goes. Super easy to pick out the info on it and I mean...it's cool as hell looking.
I like it Why don't you make one for square watch
Wonderful. If you ever update this I would like to see some iteractivity to open screens like compass, weather forcast, stopwatch.  Well worth the money. Am easy to see and functional watch face
VO5 Excellent A really great watch face
Great theme. Wish you could change colors. Love the settings option and the layout. Great design.
Love it...
Thy Best Face Out There. So.much info on the watch you can use. The 1st one i brought for my moto 360. Keep it coming and just put all of the watching in one bundle for a price
Moto 360 All around worth the money, hands down  Dear programmers tho, give me the option to switch up the color scheme, even a couple color options with the same layout would be cool. Also, maybe I'll get used to it, but, that would be cool if it was 112 instead of 12 twice.. but hey.. I dig different so maybe it'll grow on me Nice work
V05 watch face on moto360 Very nice watchface with lots of detail.
One of the best faces so far
Great Watch face. Love the face Has everything time time, weather and battery life at a glance.  What would make it perfect is if your able to change the color scheme.  Feature request I guess.  Still awesome.
Great improvement over the V03 Very crisp, clear text and a ton of information packed into the watch face. Excellent work.
So far I'm impressed works really good.
