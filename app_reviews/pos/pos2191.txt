Bought for my son but I couldn't put it down... Such a fun app...I originally bought it for my 5yr old son and I played it too see if he would like it, I liked it soo much I haven't told him about it in fear of having to share LBVS don't judge me p
Perfect I love this app it is so addicting i mean i am having no problems so far but i will be sure to write back if i do experience problems later on
Aku nak tido la  p The first one was there and then the rest is up  To view this message and all of you and your family is going to get the most popular and I will not be the family Christmas tree is not only to
I love it I love it              Hchchdj.    Nnghhfhf my mass effect is a key role as the so horny and family and family is that paper on ion the other side is the walking to activate the so I can do you want it in
You have to cook and give alto the costumers and give drink and serve them and take their orders and basically keep their happy upI like it but I do it fast so if you get the demo one once you pass all the levels you could just erase the games or go back and finish all the levels that you don't have three stars to but I would just erase it cause once you go back you sometimes get bored
Pretty Fun Its a pretty good game. practically the same as when I used to play it on my Mac Book. Only bad thing is that you can't rotate the customers when your seating them to get that perfect color boost.
Love it It's fun but all u pretty much do is clean dishes and take orders be careful they get angry quick
its fun but... it just wants me to pay for missions and some of us don't have a credit card
Love it Its amazing its like you work In a restaurant its just so amazing you can serve give people stuff and the levels become harder so watch out there are some angry people that can't wait that can't be patient so they get very angry and then they go so be quick but then you have to pay for most of the  levels and thats the bit I dont like please fix it thanks for reading it the ones that have cant wait to see what othes have wrote bye
