INCREDIBLE Absolutely breathtaking. Nearly all my apps have been changed. The ones that didn't, still got some pizaz. I feel like I'm using something that controls Iron Man's suit or that computer from Tron. One thing, it would be awesome if the emblem in the background was actually a sort of phone status indicator. Temp., RAM, and such. Still. EFFING LOVE IT. Oh...and the customization makes all negative arguments irrelevant. LG G3
