Get this app Ignore the people saying it doesn't work, I've got a Nexus 7 and it works perfectly, amazing graphics, 5 stars and 1'd
Great App Great App, exceeded my ecpectations, only slight criticism is not being able to have the app more than 2 computer players. But great buy.
Bought it 2 days ago And wow it blew my mind away. A good app to pass time in between gym sets. Game is not that hard that it is impossible to dominate yet not easy enough to let you win everytime. Game mechanics are so simple only nincompomps could not figure this one out right of the bat.
