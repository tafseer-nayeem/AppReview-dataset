Good Its awesome but needs more stuff for the vehicles and it needs more mud and the mud should be sticker so you could get stuck and it would be awesome if like when you get stuck in mud you had to use a different truck to pull it out other than that the games awesome
Great This game would be so much better if u could add off road tractor trailers to haul logs or gas
Add were you can turn off 44 and get stuck in the mud part
Cool offroading game but high prices I like the game because it kinda reminds me of the PC game spin tires. I also like the array of vehicles. Some new vehicles I recommend  are tow trucks and 18 wheelers. Also please lower the prices for the vehicles. Other than that it is worth 99 cents.
