Rummikub Fun game and great exercise for the brain. Pity there are so many crashes when playing online
Brilliant game Love the ease of play. All the fun without the hassle of moving real tiles around and having to have a massive table. Can play with others even when the family don't want to join in. I have had a couple of 'errors' when it has lost my game,usually when I was winning but hey ho
Love the game Wish there were more features for chat, presents, more options for time, etc. Also, maybe bonus missions of some type where you get point boosts since there's such big gaps between leveling up.
Love the game I love playing the actual game but currently have no one to play with. I can get engrossed in this app
Love the game,but it keeps freezing 
Addictive game Hours of play great game
Love it Great multiplayer game, always find partners. Fun fun.
