I'm usually not the kind of person that leave reviews, but this one quite deserver it. I ALLWAYS had problems with file manager and the file manager that camed with my phone. But Xender is the only one that let me transfer files from my pc to my phone without a single problem. And its sooo faster than the old LG PC Suit . I'm actively recommending this app to anybody that needs a file transferringsharing service.   There is a big 5 start for you guys, i wish you luck with next projects.
I love the speed Very fast file transfer. I send a 120 MB to a pc in just  30 sec i use zenfone 2. It would take more than 10 minutes with Asus Share Link. One thing i don't like is when i want to send a file to a pc  all files in my galery is shown on pc. It would be nice if i can just push a file to a pc without showing everything i have in my phone.
Superb App new update makes it better Great work by the team. Really appreciate it. Transfer speed is just amazing. Deserves 5 stars. Keep it up guys

Please include support for android 4.1.2 Include more features for 4.1.2.It has got some bugs and is slow on my phone.
I am expecting offline chat feature It would be better if you would  add offline chat feature.  I dont think it is a big deal to add this feature in your application.  Please think about it.. I will be expecting this feature in the upcoming updates
