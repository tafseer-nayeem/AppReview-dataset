Really Good I like it so far but I don't  use it much  but what I have used it has worked well  I like how you can edit on your mobile and it updates everwhere.
Must add the 'comments' option FINALLY ADDED It's a great app now that ' comment' option is added Thank you 
Amazing Great spreadsheet, works fast, connects to everything, has all of the features you need.

Very good portable spreadsheet app. Has a whole load of useful functions and while it isn't Microsoft Excel it will probably do most things you need and a few others too.
Spreadsheet Editing spreadsheets on the go,or at home.
