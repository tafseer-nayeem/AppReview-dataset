Best true farm sim. GIANTS Software really knows there thing. The best true farming simulator on the market. This is my second time buying this game had on my old account. I also recommend the PC version.
The best of them all. If you love farming, this is the only option you have. Come on, two dollars That's a great deal for a game like this, right I recommend to all children and teenagers who love farming, or who simply love great games.
Quite fun Even though it is the old version it is still fun for those that don't have Farming Simulator 2016
