You do not necessarily need this Marshmallow developer preview 3 natively supports mounting usb devices but the app asked for this plugin to access the drive anyway. Mine was mounted under mntmediarw so I could access the drive without this plugin. But since this is the most well designed, fully funtional file explorer on the Play Store I think an additional 0.99 towards developing this app is totally worth it.
Great plugin for a great app Plugged in my new sandisk USB drive and opened solid explorer... it automatically recognized the drive and promoted me to install the otg plugin Works great.
Works You just saved my bacon on an 8 hour flight because I accidentally formatted my stick as NTFS, which Marshmallow didn't support natively. Great addition to an already great file browser.
Works great On my rooted N5 and on my stock N9
Excellent Solid Explorer plugin for my tablet.
Plss enable write support for ntfs format too soon enough...
Not working please fix.
Excellent
Issue resolved The new update has now resolved my issue, thanks
Works great on Nexus 5 This makes file transfers simple without having to use the cloud.
Shouldn't be charging for this but it works
Works great with Motorola Nexus 6
Plain and simple Works as advertised
Took a few updates but no longer crashes. It copies files to OTG drives just fine. The best.
