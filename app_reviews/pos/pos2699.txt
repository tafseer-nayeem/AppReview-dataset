Love it Et  has been sent by a real live human
Fun fun fun It's awesome because of the different modes
Awesome One of the best games
GREAT Good but needs flags please I love this game  and needs to record stats and injures and contracts
I love this game the only flaw is that it's really hard to do a skill move I have to press skill move 10 Times for it to work
It is an awesome game. I just wished it had longer quarters.
2 things wrong 1 EA we NEED a scramble button. It is so hard to scramble because in order to scramble you need to pass the line of scrimmage that is hard. 2 EA if it is possible you need to update the game so if you aren't playing with WiFi you can still play season mode because you don't need WiFi for season mode. Thank you.
This is the best game and make your team is the  new orleaons saint
Can you add instant replays please
Football life This game is super cool it is like real football
Updates I love this game but can you add dirt stains on jersey and flags and injuries.
