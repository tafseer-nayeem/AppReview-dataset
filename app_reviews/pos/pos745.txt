So far I am extremely happy with ios finding and Android finding together in one app. This should have been done a long time ago
Best app to track. There is no difference between free and paid version.
Very good and simple app, keep up the good work
Works great on both iPhone and my Android.
Excellent App, that does the job
Great
Love it  I know where my boyfriend is at all times  This is a really handy app so you can know how long it will take someone to get to you as well as being able to locate the phone if it gets lost.  Obviously, it doesn't work if the phone is switched off so if it has been stolen you'll never see it again but immensely useful otherwise
Easy to use Simple little program that does just what I need finds the phones quickly. Nice new features in latest update.
Best app
Excellent Excellent tool. Using it since more than 3 months and works perfectly to locate any iDevice
Works great.
Amazing app Works every time on both my Galaxy S4 Phone and my LG Tablet.
Happy in sj Love this app helped find my daughters iPhone and now I can keep track of her when she goes out. I have the paid version and definitely worth paying for.
The best app ever This is just amazing. Does what it says it should.
