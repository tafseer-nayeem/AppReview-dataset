I wish it did talk That would be nice
Definitely LOVE this app This is such a good app. Im definitely falling in love with this one, but since my Japanese is really bad, I hope you guys give it a thought to make the English version. 
How can I change the language to english
Excellent app, totally free with various kind of stories.
Great app when I miss the Japanese comic culture in overseas.
Very good No lag, loads fast perfect app. However I am not fluent in Japanese and I hope they give it translations
 So glad a friend recommended this
English translation please

It's addictive I cannot avoid checking everyday.All comics are so attractive
Random guy Haha i can't read anything Xd but the art looks so nice. The app works great
 

 ,OK  
Good for those learning Japanese. Its good practice for those that want increased Kanji skills, and also no furigana for most of the series. Anyways, good selection of manga as long as you are able to read Japanese. Stop complaining about no English.


It really good
 
Halo kancaku Nice application
