Can't back outwith new update the issue is fixed Never had issue with app. I use it religiously. Until latest update in Aug 2015. Only way to exit app is to close it in the phones task manager. Not a big deal or major hassle but still something that requires attention by developers.                    UPDATE Oct. 28 2015 just had an update and now app backs out like it should. It's back to working like a charm.
