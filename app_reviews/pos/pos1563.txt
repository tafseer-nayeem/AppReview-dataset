I am in love with it It is the best app ever it is best for someone that loves text with there best friend and you can call too is that amazing i will give it a 5 not even a 5 an 10 in fact
OOVOO Its just like face time the king that does annoy me is that when you have sent a message you don't know if they have read it grrr
Oovoo It was a good app I could face time or ring them normally it was a really good thing to do to text your friends. If they couldn't contact u in any other way.......
Great to stay in touch Me and my kids use this app to see my husband and their dad is awesome it's a great way for my kids to stay in touch with their dad during the day
