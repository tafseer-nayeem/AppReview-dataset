Blackbird Still love it, but there needs to be an option to Shoot The Moon bidding that you will capture every point and getting 500 points to do so, but also set back 500 points if you don't
Addictive I love this game. I give it 5 stars because they seem to have fixed the problem of it force closing. Highly recommended
I love this game. I don't know why I can only play it on my phone. I would like to play it on my laptop. For you who are talking about the Bird being played too soon. You have to change the settings to RTO. Rook Trump Only. Check the rules section to do this.
Excellent Game I love playing this game.  The ability to create a custom rule set makes this game perfect.  If you love to play Rook then you need this game
I love it because it's very similar of how I'll play but I wish you could add points to a card because I play with the 1 card as 15 points
Rook as it should be... Great gameplay, adjustable rules and settings. Shoot the Moon is all it lacks.
If you like rook this the game for you. You can set the rules how your family play for the most part.
LOVE this game So much like playing the real game. No glitches A great way to improve your skill for playing with friends around the table.
Amazingly Awesome The best card game ever And to boot, you can set your own house rules.
Exactly like Rook. amazing as I grew up on this game and now can play whenever I want.. great game.
Great I really like being able to create my own rule set, so I can play the way I learned Rook
