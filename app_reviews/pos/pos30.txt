Wish you could set up playlists like YouTube our Netflix but it's a great app
Bare Necessities Gives me advanced info about upcoming events and current fight card. To all those whiney crybaby reviews... really It's an app. Not the freaken magical oracle to solve all your life's problems.
Very poor app Every time you update this app you make it worse now is total crap. There is no info on upcoming fights, no info on fighters and nothing works that's left. It was a great app a year ago now it's pathetic.
Great and fast app I download the app to watch the fight. Best app ever. There was no blackout and run perfect. I recommend this app to everyone who like to watch ufc.
Knockout app Awesome stuff here
