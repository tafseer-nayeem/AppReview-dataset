Good for collaboration As a university student I generally use Docs for writing projects in groups before transfering the text to Office Word for formating. The tools for writing simultaneously work seamlessly and do a good job. More features and improvements are always welcome.
Great for on the go This app has been so useful for the last week sense I've had it, I love that I can type my new book offline and google servers will auto upload it when I connect to wifi again. I use it mainly for homeworkschoolwork, but I recommend it for everyone
