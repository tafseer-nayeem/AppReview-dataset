Addictive I find these types of games addictive and fun when you have time to waste. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone
Wonderfully frustrating First, ya must move the new game button... Secondly, the game is a great way to waste time  Somewhat frustrating.  Level 65 arcade is impossible to beat. Have the creators ever played this levelAny clues as to how to get past it Ya could provide some clues. Hint, hint
