Finally After the update, the app works flawlessly, thank you devs for finally fixing the app. I can read my comics with ease
Legitimatley Amazing The new update fixed everything that wasn't already perfect about the app. Love it
Awesome app Great way to read comics.
My most used app I love it.  Yes there are bugs and it does crash,  but the content is better than any other media I consume.   I love binge reading an entire event
Great for comic lover I have no idea what people are complaining about i have never had an issue with this app. It is a good price just 10 bucks a month.  maybe issues could be online quicker.
This app is really worth the money. Sometimes its difficult to load pages but this app is still my favorite
The improvements just keep getting improvier I've been using this app for a few years now, and they just keep fixing bugs and making it better.
