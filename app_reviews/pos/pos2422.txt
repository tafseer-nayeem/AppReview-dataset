Great app. Requested the need to update for the community map and a few days later it's done.  Great response time. Very functional as well. Can do just about everything the PC version does.
Crashes A was crashing since new map release but new version fixed issue. Can't fault the developer for great support
Wow This app is working perfectly
THE tool all BF4 server admins have been waiting for Fantastic app, works so smoothly and is optimised for touch control beautifully, at 1.66 its a steal for what it gives you, 24 hour Admin oversight on your servers.
It' connects then runs for a few seconds then disconnects and get error network problem, incomplete packet received. PROBLEM SOLVED THANKS DEV
Love It  This app is great was definitely worth the wait. It makes adminning so much easier. Can do almost everything that procon for the pc can do. Love that you can add or remove maps. Move players when necessary  .... keep up the good work. And thank you
