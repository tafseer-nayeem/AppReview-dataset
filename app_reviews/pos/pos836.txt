Blur background can be removed Just downloaded this app and read all of the negative comments about the blur feature. If you select no background white box with red line through it you get a plain white background. Not sure if this was the original before the update but it works for me. The blur feature is just the default now. Great app
Great App Useful, allows for great personalization. No forced watermark or hashtag when sharing. Great for modern looking, crisp photography
Amazing When you can never fit in that whole picture but really want to.....This app sorts it out 
Quit interrupting my no cropping with give you a rating pop ups when I've already rated you. Unless you want one star 
Awesome app You don't need any other photo editing apps if you have this one
Love  this app I'm a selfie freak... it's most annoying when for one u try to post to instagram and it automatically zoomed in...this app fixes that problem and also has all kinds of fun things to play around with..
Cool Really cool helps me with the ugly photos
Excellent app I loved it.... It has all the possible options one can even think of 
I LOVE THIS APP SOOOOOOO MUCH it really helps me make cool things love it
Thanks Thanks to this app. Been using it for quite some time but now that IG has already updated it to allow no cropping of pics, uninstalling this now.
Adds Too many adds but still 5 stars expecting you ppl to reduce adds
