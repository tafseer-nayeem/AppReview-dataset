Crashing way too much Loved this app but these days it takes 4 or more reloads to read one article. And if it's a slide show there's no chance. Haven't made it past page 3 in months. Far too difficult to get the info needed. Contemplating uninstalling. Pls fix it.
Awesome app but... Maybe add goalkeeper clean sheets under stats Just noticed that now
Very Convenient Every article on Man Utd is notified for me to read them

Hi Hi
Forever United I love this app im a die hard united fan. But im asking if u can put in a widget for us to use as well. Thanks again
It's ontime and keeps you alert of the different topics in football, from my experience I would promote this app in any communicative way
Great App Very usefull. Very good presentations. It's mostly about Man. United, of course, but you can still follow the teams from the Premier League and the other countries. Great job, 5 stars
All you need from a fan's point of view. Full coverage of news, transfers, gossip from the world around Manchester United. Videos. Polls. Surveys. List goes on. If your a true Red. Then this is a must have app. Bring on the season.
