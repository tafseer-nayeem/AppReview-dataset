Simply awesome. My grandchildren at two and a half just love this app and  just about know all of the words to their favorites.  Thank you so much for this Special app we really have so much fun with it.
2yr olds fave app My two yr old son love this app I do agree it needs more songs but it is great and worth the 1 whatever it was. A from us
Nice interface for kids. Needs more songs song packs  i'll pay. Would be nice if you could lockout home,menu,back keys. EVO
I.usually don't find it necessary to pay for apps for my 2 year old. granddaughter but this is so worth it. Easy to use. We love it
Great app easy to use. My 3 yr old knows how to open and navigate the app. Saves me from having to endure the agony of catchy kid songs.
Absolutely love it Great sound quality My little one loves it A must have
Wow Great app So good my kids were fighting over the phone.
Great My toddler loves it and I love that there are no videos to watch but the buttons for each song are colourful and she knows exactly the song she is picking
My daughter is obsessed with this app She loves playing it over and over
