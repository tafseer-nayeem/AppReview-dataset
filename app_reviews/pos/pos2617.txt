Addictive game Love the controller support Makes the game perfect. But why don't I get the achievement of 5 freestyle sessions completed even if I got the one for 50
Cool game I've noticed that whenever someone decides to write a review for any game, it's almost always for negative reasons but this game truly is a cool game, so thanks guys
Awesomeness Best snowboard game ever some many different characters  tracks so u never get board theres different boards  upgrades as wellits so good
Best dang snowboarding game I have ever played on a mobile device
Sick Finally someone has found a body rotation engine that is somewhat realistic Super fun.
5 stars, but ... For an Android app, this game is 5 stars as the best snowboard sim on the market.  Smooth analog controls, ingame currency store items, and slippery slopes.  Would love to see a Story Mode or a createacharacter addition in newer installments.  Maybe connected slopes on a single mountain Ski lifts and all
Great game Love this game  lots of challenges to keep me playing.
F yeah I love itttt. I just don't know how to balance a grind. Haha
