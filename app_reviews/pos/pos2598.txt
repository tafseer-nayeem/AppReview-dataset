Amazing. Worth my time  A great game designed beautifully with perfection of each single detail. Thanks to the Creators for providing us with such a time worthy game. Regards Azan kiani
WOW.. Just try WILD WALLET App Using this referal d 1050157 and earned points.. you can use the points for any games specially The Clash of Clans...ok
Plug away... and you get passed 5 Do the bases over, save gems for hero upgrades and you can advance slowly.... its taken my attention away from clash.
Good but ADS The game itself is fun, however the ads are overwhelming.  The game also forces you to use  for upgrades, because it gets very difficult.  WE NEED MORE LEVELS Now
This Game is really CooL.... When I play this game I thought it is common game but this game is nice and creative. The concept of the game is good. The only one thing I didn't like is they provide only one hero... you have to buy the other heros. Whatever I enjoy the game I wish they updated the Game with more improvement.
God game It ismworth spending 20 dollars because you will becom so hooked you will wish it cost money.All around good game and woth your time
Allen Creeps TD Great game, little slow start off, and time delayed upgrades but fun none the less
I did love it Are you guys going to fix this game after the last update can't play and not loading at all
Really good game i like how the game was made but it would be better if another ally was free instead of buying them
Simply superb An excellent well designed game. Very very addictive if you like strategy games.
Love it Its like bloons td but different with aliens and objects troops guns i love the way how the lazers are and i love the effects.But i dont like that you have to pay for the backup heros.
Good game But needs more content.  Also I had to remove the app to see if it was affecting something else.  When I loaded it back I lost all my progress.
Great Game with Awesome interface Completed all stage now waiting for new map...
