Nice app I love this game, nice graphics and good concept , I would have gave it 5 stars but since the android update from 4.0.4 to 4.1.1 on my Samsung Galaxy S3, the game keeps crashing. Please fix it as soon as possible  Problem fixed 5 stars it is 
Good game nut i need a refund now my little cousin bought it 2years old
Really cute But.... Well its a very cute game, but the peaples who already paid for the game should hav free super powers right And wy cant u skip levels anymore Plz fix. For now 4 stars.
