Smooth The game just gets better and better with each new update. It just reflects upon how hard the game developers work to bring the best experience to SimCity.
Construtive feedback Just reporting an error with the storage count, I was making items in the shops and the storage count stayed maxed out with plus one from a freebie. I wish for the next version to be able to completely stop upgrading the buildings at the stage or size of building you want.Some of the smaller buildings are really cool.Also please make a button that can turn off your bubbles , so you can admire your city like you see your friends. Without the boundary lines too would be great.
Cool game It over heats my phone up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit
Fun Nice game. Very fun and difficult. My city has gotten pretty big. I've had no probems with this game, all though, it would be nice to have more ways to get more simoleons, other than that, no problems.
GREAT Game I just got this game about a month ago and I've been loving it. No seriously LOVING it. Everything in the game has GREAT detail from the buildings to the airport to even the water. My most favorite detail of Simcity Buildit is when the sun goes down and all of the buildings light up. In total Simcity Buildit is one of my favorite games right now.
Fun for cash Not as good as expected. Real shame that you can't modify relief or plant trees. Otherwise  quite fun according to other games of the same branch...
SimCity BuildIt First time I've played it since the original. Love how they've modernized it to a social game with others around the world
GREAT GAME I only got this game because I play SC4 and SIMCITY and thought it would be similar to the other SIMCITY games, but no its just a new type of SIMCITY. THANK YOU EA
Would be better It would be great if you put in little people in the game like how they do it on the computer
