I have a cheat you can use If you don't want your family following you, just feed them and leave the nest before they finish eating. Hope this helped
Omg Omg I love this game it's finally a reasonable game only problem make the land bigger more nests save the colors you choose and finally make a go home button for the mate and baby eagles cause like to hunt alone and fly alone but besides this IT'S AWESOME THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
Please add this The female should stay at the nest unless you need her also please add where you should be able to carry fish to your mate and the baby's don't look like baby's that's kind of wierd please make the baby's look like chicks
Awesome ADDICTING This game is so worth the money It has great graphics and easy controls. The fact that you can fly is more fun in my opinion than walking too Very addicting and I recommend this for anyone that is seeking a fun game
Best game ever I love this game so much When I got to play my mom's phone, the first ever game I got was this amazing game.it was a little hard to learn the controls.but the rest is fine.why can't we land on the ground or treesplease update the game so we can land on everything.please make the game multiplayer to.please I accidentally hit reset and I was level 59.and now I'm level 5.it was not fun at allplease fix it if you can.
Awesome This game is cool because I at first was the only eagle around until I saw something flying and I tried to follow it but I couldn't catch up to it so I used that button that makes u fly faster and I caught it and I was wondering why it said boned or something and it ment that u had a husband and when I look on that plus thing it said to reach level five to unlock an egg and knock another egg on number ten and there no ads
Awsome But you should make the chicks look like baby birds,and another thing, this game series is cool but they should be free
Awesome 
AMAZING one of the best flyingbirdsimulator games ever really good you have to get it its worth the money
Its a good game love it Thay need more land and the energy runs out to fast
Very good I didn't know what to think at first but I figured, Why not, it's only 0.99 this was a dollar well spent for what you get. I especially like how you can create and manage a flock
LOL Whenever I fly away without the family, I come back and they turn away from me as if they're mad at me It's so funny

Wow This game is so fun I love all of your games. Although I encountered a funny glitch were prey would fly, it made gameplay better. Can you make more bird games
