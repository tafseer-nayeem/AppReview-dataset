Great Good for school, but a little bit confusing to navigate. I couldn't find how to change the background. Other than that it's great
It great I am almost in middle school and we had a presentation on a book done and it was due in 4 days and I got it done.
Three generations of Google Slides I am 8 and just started school. I met this wonderful girl and fell in love but was too shy to tell her so I made a presentation to let her know my feelings. We are now happily married and have 4 kids who all make presentations on Google Slides. Our kids also have kids of their own who make Google Slides presentations so that can make more babies.
