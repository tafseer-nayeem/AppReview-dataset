Awesome product
 Great App
Abandoned... no more Adjusting my previous review... After literally years of looking like an abandoned app, the redesign introduced to iOS long ago has finally made its way here. Hallelujah
It's raining outside. The app says it's raining but there is no rain on the map. I open AccuWeather and there is a bunch of rain in my location. So I think there is a bug.
Works great Does everything I need and let's me set multiple locations so I can watch for my mom and dad.
Superb Finally a weather alert app that actually works Since I purchased this app a few days ago the National Weather Service has issued three heat advisorys for my selected locations and this app delivered these alerts to my device in each case promptly as soon as they were issued. The app has many other features that I also find appealing but the fact that the alert feature can be depended apon is itself worth 5 stars.
Works well But I wish the voice alert was louder.  It does alert every time I need it to but even with my volume turned up for music, I can still barely hear it. But it does work and it works well.
I like it The only downfall I'd that the voice in the app is so low and quite that I have a hard time hearing it. Developers if you are reading this it would be a very good ideal to add this option to allow say if you are within a Tornado or severe thunderstorms warning etc polygon that the app will continuously go off  making your device go crazy to get your attention or wake you up at night. Other than that it's a great app
The app is great, and so is the support team. Thank you
Great Perfect for Texas quick weather changes
Dont believe the liars on here This app is flawless. Everyone on here that says the app doesnt work are full of crap. This app has saved me everytime for 4 years now.
Excellent The alerts are very timely. Makes a difference when it counts.
