Jeopardy Fun

Jeopardy Love it
Never fails to be fun
Great I love Jeopardy and watching it on Tv
Good game I have not had issues with this game. It works good. I do like the multiple choice because it gives me a chance  to get the Answers I don't know.   On the valentine day game there is no difference between easy and hard, and when I did it the second time, I aced it , cause the questions are the same. Like this game.  Only one negative thing. .. if you get final jeopardy wrong they never give you the right answer
