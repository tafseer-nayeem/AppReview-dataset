Great game My only complaint is that when you reach over 10,000 it doesn't show your more than the first four digits.
Lots of distractive fun This is a good simple reliable product. Still loving it.

Alright... I'm waiting to see. They said they'd change the advertising claims for calling it classic. It should be noted this is a levelup game to get to the games you want to play. Now, fulfill the words, and this 5 stars will stay. If not, back to 1 it will go.
Still has some glichs, in the latest version, you addressed Good game now, thanks for reviewing the comments when you revising the game.
