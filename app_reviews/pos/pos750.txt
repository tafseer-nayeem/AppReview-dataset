Still the best keyboard Every now and then I try something else. For a while I was sure the Swiftkey might have edged this one out. But I eventually came back to Swype.
Simply brilliant Have been using it for ages. Incredibly easy and fast way to write. Very intuitive. It's so addictive that I find the original keyboard hard to use. Recommend it...
Still the best While I am not thrilled by the inclusion of the Dragon dictation software seems redundant, Swype is still the most accurate gesture based software for me. The shortcuts are awesome and I like the emoji icons in the suggestions.  Good stuff.
One of the best keyboard in the world Also check that the connectclient service keeps running. It should run once in a day or may be twice. Believe me this is the best keyboard for any language for its accuracy and prediction. But overall it's smooth now, very smooth. Best keyboard. Just perfect keyboard. EDIT sluggish while I type fast, the pop up catches later. Plus if I disable network connection and sync, and then enable it whole keyboard just hang. 
The best keyboard Guys at Swype, I love the way I can add apostrophes and question marks in my sentences. That is the one thing I find unique about Swype.  I capitalize letters just by swiping up. All those nuances are awesome. Keep it up.
