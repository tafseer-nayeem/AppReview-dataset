Nice So far so good its just my first day around hope that is less click before start figthing
Love it Nice p2w game. I bounce between this, Summoners War and Chromatid Souls. Three different feels but this is my fave.
Good Love this game. Much as love soccer spirits. Sweet
Brutal Its a pretty standard and pretty fun mobile RPG. Cool storyline and some nice bonuses, and not too reliant on the paytoplay idea that plagues most mobile games
East Legend Cool game The graphics are badass Too much time transitioning from one scenario to the next. But I still give it five stars
Great game I didn't think I would like this game but now its the only game i play.
now.this game.is excellent im actually glad.i put down.summoners war for this which has been better to me so truthfully they are two very great games worth downloading....  great games need i say more
Good game. It is a good game. Not far into it but fun just the same.
Awesome game log the set up Fun easy to play and lots of ways to get all the different types of currency without paying money
Great game with amazing graphics. If u like summoners war u love this.
East Legend Great game Easy to understand with a fun storyline and easy to aquire items
Not bad, so far it seems to be very fair to free players.
Only thing I would like to see is better explanation of powering up.
