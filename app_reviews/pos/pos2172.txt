It's very hard, and fast. But, I like it this way. Bought this to support Ramin Nazer
Addictive I kept dying at first but now I finally made it to the museum tier. The onetap controls are perfect. Very reminiscent of Fun Copter in terms of simplicity. The game is hard to beat but the fun part is discovering new endings. Way worth it for the price.
This game is tight as hell. I've been playing since I got it. That was 3 days ago. I can stay awake because I pretend the smallest sharks are lines of nose candy swimming into my olfactory pond.
Great game Very simplistic, extremely addictive, very creative. Excellent game
Eat more sharks with this game. I'm also looking forward to the opposite sequel Diet Shark where you start out huge and have to avoid the smaller sharks to reach your goal weight.
This game is awesome it's super addicting and totally worth the buy.
Rage This game is great But it's very rage enducing
Minimalistic. Fun. Difficult.
Best kill time game ever Easy to learn, addictive, hard to conquer. An ideal game for all ages. Great value.
This game is awesome You must get this game. It is an addictive game that you must get
Great
I can't stop playing this.
Fun game love it
