Wow Worth the money which isn't even a lot easy to earn miles to unlock characters and maps great controls though I prefer onscreen rather than gyro runs really really smooth and doesn't make my phone hot like some of these other games . Candy crush I'm looking at you smh why does that simple game tax my processor at all  Bad coding I guess
Sonic  SEGA All Stars Racing Review This is a very fun app to have but it sometimes doesn't work, sometimes I see a white screen that resets my phone and it works when it wants to, and by the way the game lags most of the time. Overall its a perfect rendition of the game we all know and love, even if its just a DS port. 
Great No lag, or other issues people are complaining about on my Note ll. Crisp, vibrant graphics and smooth game play make this cart racer the one to have
Awesome Worth every penny.Works perfectly on s3 i would be so cool if you could release all stars racing TRANSFORMED too cause i'd be the first to buy it
FOREVER SEGA Growing up as a kid and having a MasterSystem while everyone else had an NES made me realize how awesome SEGA was and still is. Anyone who complains about this app is just a whiner. This plays great on my sghi897 as well as my S4. Mizsed dearly for the console market but Sega is still kickin' DREAMCAST 2 NOW
