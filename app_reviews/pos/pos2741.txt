I love it Very grat and detailed game,I just have one problem,one of my personal goals is to defeat all the bosses,ive checked the whole map and I cannot find the boss blackfangAnd the problem is you have to be a level 40 to get a whole pack im not complaining I like challenges but why so many levels for people who first start the gameand can u add a flying ability but you have to do something  to get it, for example,you would have to kill all the bosses to get the flying ability.thnx o
How to get a pack matching the notes To get a pack, you must match the notes, in other words, match the pitches of the howls that the other wolf makes. Say the wolf says 534, you must copy that exact same pattern or else you won't get the wolf into your pack. So to get it you must basically match the pitches of the wolfs howls. I hope this helps you guys.
I love the game Can you put villages with cages with sheep and cow and can you make it when you get the bat wings  you fly and put people and hunting doges it would be epic and make the map bigger plz do it

Little help for rating people Well you guys keep asking how can we make a pack how can we have pups I'm level 18 and I know the answers so to make a pack you attack a wolf wene one of your boxes under your name are unlocked attack the wolf until under its name says bond then you try to listen and get pitch of howling the same as the wolfs,now for pups you can't mate sorry,but you can find a pup wolf and bond with it hope this helps bye

Looks cool Questions how many bosses             How do u get pups           How do u get fishi  Oh and my bro thinks its like Minecraft 
I fond out how Its pretty easy to get wolfs in your pack all you do is get in battle with it then press bond then listen to the pitch of the wolf then match it but the time is short so you must have very good memory and do it quick. I hope this helped you
