FINALLY It's not as good as fruity loops but its the best dubstep maker I've found on Android. Even the adds are not too bad. Plus its free. I would have payed money for this one
Looooooooooooooove dubstep To whoever created the app thank you so much now I can create my own dubstep time to party.
Wow Excellent for making your own dubstep, the only issue I notice so far is that it takes around a minute to load the app on my LG G4.
