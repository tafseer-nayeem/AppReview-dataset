Jeopardy is a Classic choice Easy gameplay, customizable avatar, easy to follow instructions. And you can turn off the annoying music if it gets to be too much.
Fun Enough This app is fun enough to keep me entertained without being bothered by ads. Very well done and true to the television version.
Love it The problems I had before have been resolved. Thanks goodness love this game
I love this game. A little glitchy as in shutting down unexpectedly and not saving my setting choices between games but so far i am enjoying it.
Great game, but needs more avatar customization options and maybe even the option to choose the categories of questions
Only one complaint.  The bottom of longer clues is not visible on my device. It does not bother me much stone I play solo.
Perfect Everything I expected.  A fun way to learn trivia. Inspires me to research subjects I'm not familiar with.
Would recommend it to all j players Great game to play at home
