So worth it. If you know how to use it and have time, you can track all your food purchases, do meal planning, and not forget.  Esp. If you need to go to different stores. Then there is no excuse to not have healthy food.
I have used this app for years, happy  to buy the key and support the devs They have a pretty comprehensive website to show you how to set it up to get the best use out of the app. If you take the time to set it up, it is, by far, the best shopping tool out there, in my opinion. Also, if you have any issues, or trouble finding something, contact the devs. They have pretty amazing support They have always helped me with any issues, before and after I purchased the key
Awesome app Been using it for couple years, I even donated before the Pro key was available, like it that much. Takes a little bit to configure it for me personally but worth it. Use it everyday.   Tech support is always quick, responds in minutes, not days like other apps. You will love it.
Great App Very useful app.
