I love inside out I  anger,disgust,fear,joy,and sadness.I'm on level 27
Awesome game I love this game. Had an issue with purchasing gems, I emailed Disney and they refunded my money within 3 days. They were so helpful the lady new exactly what she was talking about. Some levels are a pain tho an hard to beat unless u pay money.
Really fun game I really love this game play it everyday but I just recently switched phones it would be nice if I could somehow sync my progress some how so I won't have to start all over again on my other phone I'm already to disgust I would really hate to start all over again because it took a while to get there, other than that this game is really awesome and fun
Its one of the best games eeeever I love the movie the idea of how all emotions can work together to make something beatiful about us creatures...this game is cool and very funny sometimes..it makes me happyyy..yeyyy lovee it
LOVE THIS GAME Awesome game For the people saying you must purchase gems or other in app items, that is not true... I have yet to spend a single cent playing the game and I am on level 250 awaiting new levels before I am able to move on. I love that the newest update made it so it connects with Facebook now The ONLY complaint I actually have is PLEASE HURRY WITH MORE LEVELS It's so frustrating playing so far then waiting days and days for new levels to be added. Again GREAT GAME
Puppies Best game ever you should play first it start with joy,sadness,mad, discussed,fear.
Amazing All the little details to the orbs' design to the big ones such as all the characters' speech really hits home 
Inside out thought bubbles I love this because joy makes me happy and sadness makes me sad and cry all day even anger makes me mad at someone like my sister and my mom and dad
