WMAs are now supported. Couldn't play WMA files on v1.6.0 and later but devs fix this on v1.6.6, Again become best media player.
Google play  My new phone came with the google music app i personally do not like so i was looking for a simple music player that i could use every day. The second i saw VLC, I knew i didn't have to look further. Thank you guys, and nice job
Excellent Media Player You won't need to look any further than VLC player for playing audio and video. I also have the desktop version and it plays whatever I throw at it.
No ads, more pleasure Love this cos there are no advetising pop ups. I'm too tired with those ones. VLC is simple enough with all necessary features.
Interuption in video playing... Vlc is best but as you're working to develop it, I've found interuption like breaking the photos in video playing when forwarding, replaying after exit from the time it started where i left it.. in ver 1.6.6..... this problem wasn't in 0.9.3..... so please fix it.
No need to convert files Works just like VLC on my PC, so no learning curve. Intuitive controls.  Plays my MPGs without conversion. Let's me slow down replay, which is great for practice videos.  Let's me speed up replay for lectures,  which saves time and improves retention.
Play's anything I throw at it. Been using VLC on desktop computer for quite a few years. Glad to see you guys have it for my Moto X. No problem playing music, and videos, and no popup ads.
