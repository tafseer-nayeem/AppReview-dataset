Exactly how it seems A great title that is simple yet deep. It has an interesting learning curve, but is fun the whole time. There is a handful of in app purchases, which seem okay. Apparently some levels are better than others. I plan on purchasing at least one extra level, in addition to the introductory one included which is packed with obstacles. I loved the EA Skate. titles so this was a natural fit for me on the android platform.
Oh the butter Omfg, after the latest update it's buttery smooth 60fps all the way
Freezing Was able to buy new park after 10 mins of trying lol but just to let the devs know, it keeps crashing and freezing. Still 5 stars because I know they will fix it.
DO NOT UPDATE latest update deleted all my true credits and custom deck. Disappointed.
Great Great
I would be completely lost with out this
Only app I've given 5 stars, ever I have over 150 hours on this, my ps4 gets neglected because of this game haha. Looking forward to the update tomorrow
Good But Needs Improvements Addictive but it keeps taking away my truecredits. And my board skins won't change until I left a bad review and it magically fixed itself. However, they resolved these issues I recommend this same to everyone
Great game I have nothing bad to say about the game, however I bought a park and it will not download. It says 0  downloaded even if I restore purchase and reinstall app. Please help
Good but.. The game is great but it would be helpful if the set marker position button was faster and easier to get to rather than it being in the help and options menu. Also i was wondering why all of the true skate logos have been blacked out
Sick Game This game is awesome. Every part. But I think it would be cool if you made a scooter game too, I think it would be dope
I think it would be better if you just had to tap the slow motion button and will stay slow motion till you tap it again
