Addicting Can't play it for a long rime bc it gets boring after 20 tries, but I cant help but to play it again and again.
Fun for your brain This game actually requires thought and a little skill, while not being so intense that you can't play a quick, reactive game. And it's addictive
Best time pass Loved this game. The only sad part is I completed the endless mode too and couldn't play any further. But the best part, I feature in the top 100 list.
Great I have been so eager to play this game. When a searched it this was the first thing that popped out. Trust me if you haven't played this before, this is recommended. Enjoy the game

Cool math game This is really a cool gameextremely challenging. I have played 4 games so far...keep getting a bit further each time. This is a great game if your mind is just overloaded. I find it really helps me wind down.

I almost won a lot but somehow it plans ahead so you can never win. Even though it might just seem like im bad at the game, on other apps i always to win, weird huh
One of the Best puzzle games on the store The only thing that bothers me is that it has so many ads and it is distracting
Simple but addictive Public Leaderboard must have been hacked, but lots of fun well worth trying, though it is a bit annoying that the game keeps asking me to rate when I have already written this
