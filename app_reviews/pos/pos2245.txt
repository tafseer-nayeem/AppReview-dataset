House of fun I'm getting to like this game a lot,the only problem that I have is the fact that if you want to level up fast,then you have to spend some money,  and that's when I come up against a brick wall as I can not afford to spend money on coins for the game at this moment in time, p.s you have fantastic graphics.
House of Fun Colorful large pictures, with fun oriental music the pointdash winnings could be much greater, but still a good deal.Great fun.
XTRA BIG WINS There's a lot of really cool games  a wide variety of themes to choose from. Love that the have holiday themed games My favorite game right now is Alice  Friends, but I have only hit the feature 1x  it's so frustrating, especially since my husband seems to always hit it 
Fun Fun Fun I love thos game, but I'm always running out of credits to play. Need to offer more free coins
Medusa money  the rate the apple shows up now it'll take years to win the apple jackpot why not just take it off
It's my daily relaxer.  There is always a new featured game, once you start it's hard to stop.
House of fun These games are fun and awesome. I enjoy them all. Thank you for the wicked evil special. I wish I can get more bonus.
Only been playing a short time, I went for the game with the progressive JP, and figured what the hey 1000 bet only having 2000 to play..I figure I could always download another game, but what do you know I actually hit the Major JP.. unbelievable... Starting to love this game , had previously read the negative reviews so thought I'd shareTks
Loads of fun Having fun just have bad luck at times and takes a while to rebuild points. Still a great time
