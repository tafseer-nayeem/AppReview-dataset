Simple, pretty, challenging. Title says it all. Buy it.
Awesome Great time killer with slimes 
Love the game... I mean cool and funny story and dialogue, great gameplay and of course cute graphics
Nice pace Loving the game and it appears to have a nice pace. Already well worth the time. Controls need work or a setting to adjust but will probably just save up for unlimited auto.
Pretty good It's worth the money lol
Wewtawewt Definitely worth the price, full of cute slimes that die by ur hand
Yea Fun game worth its money
Great Time Waster I'm enjoying the game so far. The art direction is fun, and the progression isn't terrible. It can be a bit grindy, but that's what I'm looking for in a bathroom break game.
