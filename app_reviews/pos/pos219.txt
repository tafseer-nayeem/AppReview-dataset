For sure You have to spend some time watching videos, which is ok, but it does not always credit the account. Also runs out of videos to watch to get more minutes on the phone. Other than those two issues, great app for what it is.
Works Great Does what it says. May start buying minutes, but don't want to lose the minutes I buy or lose my number for not using it enough.
Great app Keeps me in touch when I don't have a service card on my phone. Plus gives me an alternative number otherwise.
Updates The calling still needs some tweeks, but the updates makes it simple and quick to get your message across.
