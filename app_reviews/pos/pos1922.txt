There is about a kmh difference between my bike computer and this app. Not sure if ita an app issue or phone gps... may try anothe phone and report back.   Update. 11.12.15 purchase the speed cadence sensor and the app distance is now the same as my bike computer now.
Best XC Bike Computer App Out There I do mostly XC riding, and this app is perfect. I have a phone mount for my bike and use that as my bike computer. It gives me all the stats that I need and then some, and the whole mapping feature is amazing. I really enjoy having the personal voice coach that tells me when I have reached certain milestones in my ride. This is by far the best XC bike computer app out there. Nice job, Runtastic.
All I Need for Mountain Biking or Cycling Is Here I love the GPS tracking of this app, works well and fast. I can even track my workout offline with no problem. Autopause feature is smooth. Voice coach is also useful. The only drawback is I can't create my own route straight from the app, I can only do it from Runtastic site, but it's no big deal.
Phone Excellent app, never fails, always tracks my ride and my son's ride so I know where he is, tracks my ride  so I can see elevation and gradient .
Excellent aplication Lots of detailed information about your workouts. I recommend it to any one. Simply the best application for mountain bike. I have mine integrated with the cadence and speed sensoe and the runtastic heart rate monitor.
Brilliant, but why can't I connect g watch r Seems a bit pointless when other android wear devices are supported.
Great bike app. Tried S health but this is so much better. Much more detailed information. Would improve if it would allow me to listen to my spotify playlists so I could manage what I want to hear when I ride. Would even pay for that in app feature. Otherwise, pretty happy with it. Great job
Best mtb app Worth for every penny, it records everything, stores everything, maps everything. Great app
