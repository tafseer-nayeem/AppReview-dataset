Notification spam This is a great game, my favorite by far.  But there needs to be an option to turn off push notifications I get st least 5 an hour, for daily prize alone, even when game is open.
Bring back a few things Can u guys bring back some old guns, but make it so that you can buy with  diamonds, bring back the awesome music and nerf the storm hammer plz its so . Plz answer back. PS CAN U GUYS PLEASE FIX THE ADS Every time a match ends the ads pop up and it makes me leave the game. 
Awsome But can we gets some More animations when flying on a jet pack I will understand if it takes to much space and time... I also agree with brad Sherman can we test weapons before purchase I got a solar power sniper but it didn't turn out to be useful. Maybe a new menu where you can submit fan made weapons to be in the game.
Love game but... Please make it so that u can test wepons  before u buy them like in a shot ting range and u can choose wat type of armor the enemy has so that u know if it's good or not before u buy it  plasma releaser  I'm looking at you

Good game but The controls are smoth good gameplay but the wepons are way to op I mean when your a low level you get your butt kicked almost every sever and that's not helping at all can you guys make the damge on the wepons a little more reasonable
Pixel Gun 3D This game is cool,but the storm hammer when slower,so I wasted my moneyJust to say,why is the cupids how and the others all these need gems,its hard go buy,Btw those with lower level can buy but not us.That's not fair,pls fix it.Thx,this game is still the bestAnd they said that there is 50 more maps,but don't have...
Love the game but 1 thing Ok love the game play it like everyday 1. Thing can u add area 52 army skins 2. Can u add a shied or a juggernaut from CALL OF DUTY. GHOST if u do thank u very much still 5 stars 
A Suggestion I honestly love the game, but the one thing that slightly bugs me is the skins... Can you guys add more skins andor add a system, where once people make skins, they can publish them to the skin store, or something like that. Hmm...
Can u make the enable skin Editer less than 50 Coins to 20 pls and pls can u add lightsabers and Blasters Because of the new Star wars Film
Love it Its awesome I love how it has so many things to do instead of just story mode and multiplayer. only thing I don't like is that the guns and capes are hard to get.
Suggesting update I think there should be a trading system where you give the item or amount of money to the person then you send.The person sends the amount then the person accepts or declines the amount then they get the money or item then they leave the menu.
Its good Its good but I cant go on google and can u add 2 gamemodes one of the will be a hide in seek and two is were there is one coin in a random place and if we find it we get 4 coins love the game keep up the good work
