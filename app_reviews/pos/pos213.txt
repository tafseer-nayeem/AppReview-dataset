Give em a 6 Awesome app needed it to play old vid clips im to dumb to figure free way out lol. I switched from s4 to note 4 and it works great Thx guys
No problems great app easy to use I don't normaly give feed back unless it's on sumthing that has worked better then expected
If photos  are your thing... ..... you definitely need this outstanding app. I could go on and on about it, but it's best to let the app sell you 
Amazing. This app is great, but the basic reason i bought the app is resolution, slide, set the wallpaper, rofl, well its about being an amazing app and to support devs. Thanks for the great tool.
Don Kelley I want this to work so bad but every time I try to activate the license it crashes.  Now I am without the license and the money.  Edit  After emailing the developer, he quickly resolved the issue and now I am happy to say the license is installed and work well.  Good Job.
Love The App I don't have access to the camera roll anymore.  I just upgrades to Android 6. 
Great tool Man, did I need this to access and sort the massive amounts of photos I have in Picasa and G, Thanks
Great App I have 100s ofnthousands of photos in Picasa.  This app does just what I need.
Awesome  I love this app and so glad I purchased the license. I save all my pictures and all of my videos. Perfect way to store my media  well worth the money for the license
Awesome Great app Perfect for hiding things from our kids and sharing between us. Love it. Thanks
