Amazing It's a great app for practicing and can really improve your skills fast. Only thing that bothers me is the screen not rotating the opposite way.
I own several blackjack training apps and this is by far the most fun and best. It lets you pick  whatever system you want to learn . One thing to note though this app only teaches card counting. If you want to learn basic strategy you need to use different app.
Great App. Challenging and informative. Only way to improve the app is add an ability to play blackjack and count at the same time
Good stuff Galaxy tab pro 10.1
Train here Best card counting app ive ever played.  Fun and challenging
