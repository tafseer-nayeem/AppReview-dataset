AWESOME THE BEST Best racing game i have on my phone Including asphalt 8 i have one question though.. What does the car symbol on the middle of map mean I have a good internet connection but it keeps saying that i don't. Please help.
Best Racing Game Graphics And the length of each race. Aggresive Cop cars. Lastly, you can play offline.

Love the game.. but This is the second time i have downloaded it and the first time i made 3 purchases of about 20 30 in total. And now that i have downloaded it the second time after getting a new phone. The game doesn't acknowledge that i ever made a purchase. Please help as i would hate to think that i wasted that money...
Whats not to love Now I just need to learn what brakes are for.
Outstanding Game This version of NFS really nailed it. The cars collection are whack, the graphics is awesome, and the gameplay is really great. One thing is that, does the police car can always keep up with our speed whatever how fast our car is I mean, that just doesn't make sense to me. I think you can add more police car in a chase for a better action and nervewracking experience,but don't make them too fast.
Force stop solution I got the solution from James Bryan Hernadez so thank you. open the game then searching for update massage will appear. When it closes count to 2 then press home button then open the game from the recent apps it will work with no problem without doing this steps again.
