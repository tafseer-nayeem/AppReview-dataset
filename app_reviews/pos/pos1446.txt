I would name my 1st born after this Does an amazing job.   Do you have 10 pages that you want to be only 1 document  Easily done  Reward these folks for their great work and buy them a coffee you soulless leech.
A nice scanner app. I use it to scan receipts plus some other things. The features are worth it. In the absence of a conventional scanning device and if you're in a hurry, this would do.
Brilliant Add push bullet and you have the complete office on your phone.
