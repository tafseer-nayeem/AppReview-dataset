A driver relaxed
Love the app. Tried the free app and decided to get the paid app. Thanks for saving my rear more than once. Definitely worth the paid version.  Keep up the great work. Everyone should have this app
Important question If the app shows only the already radars by users, no one knows about police abuse So we are protected only by static cameras on which the app is perfect Be aware from police pistols
Very very nice program
Great app. Saved me a lot of money. Works like a charm.
Mr.toto In general is cool. Had better to add support of accidents in real time. Traffic jams are very helpful too. Thanks.
Super Klassno, exal po rostovskoy oblasti nashel vse staticheskie kameri. Mobilnie zasadi Bill no neploxo skanorovat v realnom vremeni.
