Super app Must have for traveling at night with kids. Super fun and educational.
Liked it Something happened it's not working.
First app I bought Still my favourite.
Best planetarium app An excellent app for anyone that loves the night sky and astronomy.
Sky walk Never had a problem. Love this app.
can not open stuck in the star walk screen.,.
Works great in my chinese tablet and my phone
No longer having any issues.

Amazing detail
Beautiful app Beautiful artwork and a great feel to this timeless app. A wealth of information available and easy to use.  Also using Star Walk 2 which is astounding but still like to use this version on a regular basis. It's like an old friend . Great job.  
Great astronomy app This app does what I need it to do, and more.  I used StarWalk on the iPhone for many years.  It's easy to use, and has all of the information about the night sky that I have ever needed.  Now that I'm using android devices I finally got around to purchasing StarWalk for use on my new phone and tablet.  So far I'm not disappointed.  In fact, it appears that the app still performs as expected.
Doesn't  work Doesn't work hangs  and won't respond while moving Please provide an update or give our money back
Great application I really missed this when I left my iPhone, but now I get same spectacular experience as before on my android tab.
Dude...I mean, right Nice, huh it really is a Great app  Had it on my iPhone, now I'm putting on my LG G4...Thanks a Lot guys, you're the best
Love it I have a Nexus 5 and have never had an issue. This app has been very helpful when I've been stargazing
