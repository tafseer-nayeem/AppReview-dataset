Word Crack Love this game because it is quick and challenging.  However, I am very disappointed that the practice mode quite functioning.  Loved to practice whenever I had a little time to waste away.  It just stays on the same game all the time now.  What happened
There's more than one kind of crack addict Word Crack is highly addictive
Loved it. .. addicted Brings back my childhood playing boggle ...love the app.
Great game Boggle and word fans will love this game. It is fast paced and great for challenging friends and random opponents. It has an excellent word vocabulary to draw from and recognizes most words. I highly recommend this game. I only wish that there were more things to buy with the coins.
Excellent Very easy to build up coins without spending money. I always loved Boggle, and I enjoy the twist Word Crack puts in it with the power ups.
There should be an option for no power up games. How many words can you find or can the game find for you in two minutes or more.
Word Crack The best make a word game that I have played.
Love the game but should be able to see how many power ups opponent is using. Annoying that I keep being asked to rate it
Very Addicting I've been playing for months Always can come back to this game anytime and still enjoy it. 6 Stars in my book. . Only downside is waiting on random opponents taking days to finish a game that should take about 12 mins.  . Just saying  
Word Hey, who doesn't  like a descent word game Good job.
