Only get AE for free You don't get the entire alphabet for free. That said, what it does teach is good.
So far so good I'm very impressed. It's working fine for me so far. This app has what I was looking for  will not let you write the wrong direction, shows example first, and reinforces with a third round letting child do it alone but if struggles gives a hint Then celebrates success.  Also engaging and fun Great job. The upgrade for less than 4 bucks is worth it in my opinion. Thanks
Love abc The song is look like tat a b c d I f g h I j h l m o p
It's very good. It's very good app for our kid's, Seriously. I like it.
