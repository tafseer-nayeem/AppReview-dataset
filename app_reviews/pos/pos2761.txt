My 3 year old son loves it My son usually has a hard time sitting still when we go places. But since I downloaded this app it's no longer a problem He's learning and keeping busy 
Nice App My son loves this app. And I love that it doesn't require anything for you to use it. The last preschool game app
Awesome I like it because my sister can learn a lot
Love it Hi,  That was a great game. There were two things that your team might wanna add in this game.. A SAVE option were parents can save the shapes that they made. Second is the UNDO option were parents can undo shapes that they placed.   Overall.. 5 stars..   Looking forward for the insights to be available..
