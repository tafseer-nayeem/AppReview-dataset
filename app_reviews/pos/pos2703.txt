Great game, slow support After last update, you can play once, then 'new update with some additional data' does not proceed, progress stalls at 0... so finally we're done with this game.
Please change the Japan version to another version and give us gems more frequently as I have very difficulty to play . I can't uninstall because it is my most favourite . please accept my request . I have installed other game of Gameloft like minion rush I like that game too
