Works well and simply. Does everything u want in a weather app
Help After last Sony software update I lost the widget of the home screen, can someone fix please.
Great app Use this all the time, very useful and informative.
Not laggy I love having access to the weather in such a great application. It used to be awfully laggy. They finally fixed it Thank you developers
Much more buttery So much better with the new smooth as butter scrolling.  Top app, all you need right there. Use it daily.  Love the access to the rain radar.
