Amazing I love the boons you can get, and using them at the least convenient time makes my friends go mad. To all the reviews saying its rubbish only one player can use it THAT IS THE POINT. The idea is that it gives the owner a completely unfair advantage and the abillity to easily track their level and strength. Make sure you know what something is  meant to do BEFORE saying it sucks.
Pulled this out during a munchkin game... .. They all said,  that's cheating   The looks on their faces when they found out that the really is the official app and I get the boost on the screen ... Worth every penny.   Haha
This is great My friends and I play this game a lot, and I don't always have something to count my levels with. This app is great I use it every time I play and the free boon is amazing and extremely helpful.
Must have Nothing is more munchkin than acquirering advantages that no one else can match, and the boon function will give you just that. Buy this app, even if you almost never play. It'll pay off
Great app Can help you sneak in a win just when you lost all hope
Love this game. Happy to support creativity. App is cool too.
Love munchkin App helps out a lot
God Mode Must have for any Munchkin game
For the edge. 4th wall munchkining.
Please Fix Love this app. But i would like to use the custom screen, however it crashes every time... On every device.
Great app for a great game
