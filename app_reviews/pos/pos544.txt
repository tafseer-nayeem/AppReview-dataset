Great app It is not a bad way to keep up with NASCAR live, the news, and updates that are going on. I don't always have the chance to watch a race so this is the next best thing.
Great app I've never had a problem with it. I think the people that have problems with the app should check their phone and carrier, maybe get a better data plan to.
NASCAR 2015 Great coverage. Love getting breaking news as it happens. If you love Nascar this is the App for you. I  Highly recommend.
Great Love it. Have little issues and when I do it seems to be a Sprint issue. The only thing I wish I could do, is control the volume while watching the cams while listening to the radio. Radio gets drowned out but I can live with it.
NASCAR MOBILE Cameras are awesome wish raceview had real views. Best of all it works  9 months after 1st 'review I like it, but my radio cuts off and on mosaics one camera view always covered with ad. We get enough advertising. Fix this and I'll be happy.New views are insane, LOVE LOVE LOVE what has been done if you don't have it get it come out from under that ROCK Ron C. 71915 End of season 112215 Thanks for a great season awesome job this year,see you at Daytona.
