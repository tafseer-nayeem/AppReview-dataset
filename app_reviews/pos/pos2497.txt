1 out of 10 I give it a decent Love the game. Play on a Samsung Galaxy S6. Started on new server Sleepyhead Inlet. I was timing out all the time and thought it was normal until I played a different server on the same internet connection. You guys have plenty of other server's that don't timeout 7080 of the time so until the Sleepyhead Inlet server stops doing that 3 stars is all I can give being my main character is on that server. Fix the timeout issue and you get your 5 stars.
Pretty good game It is a little slow if you don't pay,  but so far I can get to what're the others are as long as you don't mind it taking longer.   I find myrtle checking it multiple times a day for quite a bit of fun.
