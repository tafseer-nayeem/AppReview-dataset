This game has surprised me I can't say I really liked this game much at all when I first played it. It seemed a little slow...a little boring. I gave it a chance and it's one of my favorites I find myself playing it more and more everyday. Give it a chance. I bet you'll like it, too Just give it a try
Fish smasher A great fast exciting game easily addicted to after only a few levels
Love it can't stop playing it even when I get stuck on a level it just makes me want to keep playing to bet the level
Ok i like the game but seriously i have probably spent 100 if not more in pearls and lives to expensive for my taste wont be playing the second part if it ever comes out
Fish smasher Collect as many as you can in the alloted moves not as easy as you think great game though
Too cute and totally addictive I love playing this game The unique facial expressions that all the different fish make throughout the game, is the cutest part
Stuck at 99 Addicting, relaxing, challenging but now stuck on level 99 thinking to quit but want to make it to the 100 level and then say good bye does eat up battery but just can't stop.
Fish Smasher Cute,fun, and silly but enjoying for now.
Haters gonna hate. This game is great. Just like all others. Having no problems with life count. And really cute...esp when clicking turtles.
Awesome This Is The Most Addictive Game Every But I Run Out Of Lifes So Fast Other Then That The Game Is Awesome
