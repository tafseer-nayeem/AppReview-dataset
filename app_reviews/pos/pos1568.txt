Comicrack Great app used it for years, other than some problems with sd card recognition issues its the best.sure they will fix it in no time 
Not perfect But still awesome and cool. Still gonna give it 5 star
Great I wasn't expecting this app to be this good. Downloaded it just to try. Now I'm using it everyday. It made my smartphone more useful. Thanks. Good job.
simple and useful. Best comic reader for CBR format. no annoying settings just scans and read your CBR files.
Issues This app is great don't get me wrong but it's really hard to put the comics in the folder for starters you should do a how to video
SD Ok guys please read if your having trouble with adding comics from your SDmicrosd. This is from one of the developers  ...................................................................   Try to delete the old, internal one with a filemanager.  Use the home button in the folder selection dialog to create a comic folder on your sdcard.  It should work.
Great app  I am using this application from more than 6 month for my Tablet, now i use this application on my android device, Tons of the bugs now fixed and now app is without any Lag and issue
