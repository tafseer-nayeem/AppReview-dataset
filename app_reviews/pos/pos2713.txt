Wonderfully done Great game and no in app costs or ads kids love it I teach pre k and have 8 grandkids in this age range . Thanks for this fun filled game and great memories we are making
It's a cool game Only thing is that they don't ask if your a girl or boy that's playing
Love it My preschooler LOVES this Plays all the time...very cool and love all the puzzles and games in it Perfect
Great fun, simple and no adverts. The only problem with this game, is that my two year old gets bored waiting for me to stop playing with it Much more to do than I expected, and no annoying ads or links to get tapped by mistake. Keeps both of us entertained for ages
My 3yo loves it, she has trouble with the overhead track laying part but works everything else out on her own. Keep up the great work.
