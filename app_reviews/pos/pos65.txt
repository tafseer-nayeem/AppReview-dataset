Addicted I love this game. Unfortunately, I got a new phone and transferred this to my sd card. It only saved the game and none of my achievements . But,  I'm starting over. I like the sling so you can quickly change without the wrong ball flying around.
Truly awsome...loved it Only thing is tht there shud be a restart option while playing levels
love it... need more bubbles love the game.. its keeps u busy and out of boredom.. The higher levels need more bubbles as it gets very difficult. also there should be an option of buying boosters with diamond when you are about to lose a game, and if we have not used boosters in a level it should be carried forward to the next levels. over all its superb I just love it. Thank you for the wonderful game.
Fun Colourful and fun to play. Cool graphics. Love the little dragons. Challenging at times. I will recommend it to everyone.
Bubble Blaze Addictive. Does NOT require Web connection to play. Great time killer with enough of a challenge to keep you playing.
Love it Sooo addicting Compared to a lot of other bubble games this is the best by far its quick accurate n im Waiting for Bubble Blaze 2
The updated Bubble Blaze This new version is even better than the old one If you like bubble popping games this one is a must. Adorable hightech graphics and a very  coolio sharp shooting pull back and aim, crossbow type shooter makes Bubble Blaze the best of the best Bubble Poppin' games available. Great job game creator's ENJOY 'John Q. Public'.
