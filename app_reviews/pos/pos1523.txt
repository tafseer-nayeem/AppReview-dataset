Fantastic player Don't let the one star reviews get you boff this app, I've used this app on a range of Android devices and it is still one of the best players out there  To all those that are crying about the ac3 player, your phone or tablet where not designed for a Home theater experience. There is an ac3 codec, you just need to go the forums and follow the instructions to get it right, it works on my tablet.
