It does work Well I downloaded this app thinking that the laser was going to do what the picture looked like it was going to do. But it didn't it only made a noise and only made it look like it will. Only the flashlights work. I wouldn't recommend this app to any one.
...The app This app is a simulator just like it says FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DUMB IT CANNOT I MEAN CANNOT HAVE A REAL LASER OUT OF IT YOU GOT WHAT YOU DOWNLOADED ...READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE THINKING PHONES HAVE MAGICAL UPDATES TO MAKE IT WATERPROOF OR HAS MAGICAL LASER OR SOMETHING ELSE...so don't think it actually has a laser that magically shoots out of your phone
Seriously did you think a lazer would come out For an app like this to be legit, you would have had to buy a phone equipped with a lazer. If  you are mad right now because a lazer didn't come out and you start to take it out on the developers, you should put your phone down for a while and try living in the real world. 
It doesn't work like its supposed to I got all the coins from playing the mini games to get the actual laser to come out. But when I got all the coins it only vibrates and only a flashlight comes out. It doesn't have the laser pointers or the colors it only shows the laser colors on screen
Ignorant people I downloaded the app so I could help the creators out from people that rate the app for, well ignorant reasons. Commonly used My phone doesn't have a laser coming out of it. Well if you read I believe the second paragraph in the read more section the creators states that the app does not make a laser come out of your phone. I don't have a quote but you can go look yourself easally. Sorry if there are any mistakes in this long reviewcorrection.
Laser pointer This is an awesome game. And to all the haters of this game you are all wrong. Sure the picture is wrong, but the sound is what the game is about and the only mini game I hate is loopy something.  thats it .
