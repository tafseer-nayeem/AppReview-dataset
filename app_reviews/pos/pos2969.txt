Root Lucky patcher patch custom Google play which will disable auto update within apps then patch the game for ' support patch for InApp and LVL emulation' guess what Everything is free D if it fails disable mobile dataWiFi and try again, congratulations
My 3yo loves it. Great game  activities for my 3 year old daughter. The only bad thing is you have to purchase all accessories to get full experience of the game.
Its awesome They shouldnt make one thing free then we gotta buy the rest.
