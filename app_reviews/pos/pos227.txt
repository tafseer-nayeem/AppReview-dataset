Fun and funny The ebojis are so funny and my friends always crack up when I send them. Kudos to the eboticon team
Great app The Eboticon app is very creative and definitely worth the price.
Love it let's add more for new year
I support I enjoy the app and I support anybody from tricities since I'm a alum but it would be awesome if the music was also incorporated, had more manly ones, or be apart of the emoji keyboard making it easier to send. Anyway it's awesome keep up the good work
Love the app I only wish more could be added
