Bought it to support Just bought it to support you guys, thanks for all the smiles you guys gave us. Sad that Matt isn't part of CH, met him at ComcCon even more saddened by the fact that he isn't allowed to even draw stick figures. Come on you guys
What's happened Even though it's up to date I'm still just getting random comics. Great for looking at the old stuff but I need something new... quick....I'm starting to shake........update. fixed. Great app. Love you guys
Awesome app update fixed So when ever you flip the phone it says it's crashed. It says if again when you flip it back. Then it randomly crashes out all the way just flipping through. Will give.5 when the coding is fixed. Edit Seems update fixed the crashing. Thanks guys 5 stars
Fabulous app Its an absolute must for any CH fan. All bugs seem to be fixed and it feels great to have lots of fun from explosm right under your thumb.
For the content not the app Content is awesome. Always been a big fan of ch and have bought it just to show support. But then, the app kind of sucks. Nothing much in it. The very least it could have notified me when a new comic comes up. The writers are genius but obviously don't know how to hire correct ppl for the job..... Or maybe they coded it themselves. In that case, lol
My favorite new cartoon Please add comment section to app. Wish I could comment on your strips.
Wow Much humor. So laugh.
Good app and now working fine on Galaxy Note 3 Enjoying the app now that the screen rotation bug is fixed  Keep up the great work guys
Great But... How do I get the comics to download automatically
Update Its been a while since I've checked out this app and it seems they FINALLY updated the UI. Much better. Excellent job guys
