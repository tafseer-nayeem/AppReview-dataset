Absa App Worked as expected no hassles except if you have any issues their automatic response is please go to your nearest branch for assistance ... Where is the telephonic helpline if I'm outta the country on one of my many trips and have an issue ...
Love the App I love the new securesure way of authentication. No sms and otp, makes banking easy.
Good So far so good though it has what I think it's minor bugs, apart from the fact that you can't buy prepaid electricity it's generally good app
Complete lack of service When I try to log in it gives me 'authentication failed' as an error. ABSA has been incredibly slow in helping me to resolve this problem. I've sent multiple emails to the their suggested email address with nothing but an automated receipt of the mail and absolutely no follow up thereafter. Very dissatisfied
Can't login It keeps showing an error message ' authentication failed, please try again later when I login with my cellphone. If I login using my laptop all my beneficiaries are gone It only started after the latest update.
New linking  feature Loved  the  new linking device  process, you no longer  have to log into the  Internet  banking in order to link the  device
Love it I can't say any thing about other banking app's.... But ABSA's banking app is really great and fits my needs This app got a lot better and is very stable on my Galaxy Note Edge. Hope they don't change it for to Braclays colours...lol
