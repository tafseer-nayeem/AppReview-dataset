It's a great game Love the color assembly.  Just think you should specify a career mode. Typically theses games have simple word's, no fun without a challenge perfection.  Job well done.
Word Search The game is relaxingly mindless...sometimes, that's a good thing
Great game Lots of different puzzles to play. I'm addicted to it
Word Search Multiple word search challenge's. I love beating my own time challenges.
