Please reply playday Great copy of hayday but like hay day pls add the fishing boat near the ship and also let us message with our friends
Free game for a free game unlike other farming games it focuses less on friends and money and more on crop management and trading whilst keeping the same game feel as other farming games as an added bonus this game doesn't use an energy system overall 810 for its genre
