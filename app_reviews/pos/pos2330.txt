What's your problem I don't see what they messed up. So far it's the same. One look and you'd think it's another stupid app that tries to duplicate a guitar no offence on a freakin' mobile that can't fit it, but it you try easy mode is just like it used too... Haven't checked out the app, that's all I found out so far. Looks as good as ever though
Just awesome Guyes if you are not a guitarist install this app. .   . It will fill your desire to be a guiterist..
