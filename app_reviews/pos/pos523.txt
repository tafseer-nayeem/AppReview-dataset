Great app Love this app but since the rust update last night chat messages are no longer showing All working correctly now  seems as though it was a problem with chat handler and not your application but thanks for your reply
Best one out there Update for most new items which is great. Be nice to see this continue. App is fantastic for any admin.
Works Using dev blog 61 and it worked normal and cracked servers very happy but it won't let me set the airdrop timer below 15 mins other than that I love this app it works well.
Works great Figured out my problem and the app works great. Directions were a little unclear on the query port. I thought it meant to add a 1 at the end of the port. Just an FYI for everyone else if your game port is 2085, your query port is 2086.
Great I don't normally rate apps, but I really like this one.
Awesome Great app, Having trouble linking my steamID to it though so it registers that i'm a mod, not sure if the command just isn't in yet but otherwise give commands and teleport's work great and the best part is its not full of trojan viruses like Rusty is HOORAY If you could tell me how to fix the linking thing this app would be 1010, right now its a 9.5 though  Thanks guys keep up the good work  oh maybe a time of day command or is that just plugin unsure
Super This apk is great It is work on experimental version. Thanks 
Awesome App Just the exact App I needed for my server
Works great Love it, its so handy to use if I can't get to my computer and do it. Saves a lot of time Anne looks neat. Would recommend.
Nice tool will it be updated to support the new Rust version
Useless at the moment Works very well now Thank you
Suggestion You guys should add a widget for the app. I still do love it though
Wiked app This app is very good, and the customer service is excellent thank you
