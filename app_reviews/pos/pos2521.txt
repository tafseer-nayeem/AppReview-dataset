Greatest all FabulousFantastic Fantastic game. The game is much like real one. Any one can learn a lot of things from this pool. Thanks for creating such a nice pool game. Great Creator
Awesome Love it, though sometimes when white ball goes down the pocket in a foul, it comes back without cuestick,  forcing you to forfeit the game which sux.
Why can I get an email from an opponent in online mode Sometimes great people meet.
I just luve the fact that its available offline No regrets go on download ppl
Nice game but highly manipulated by computer. Its designed to make you lose winning games so that we have to pay. The game designers are cowards who have no regards for talents. You are on a winning verge when it will put white ball in even if the lining is not straight. I lost many winning games this way.
Keep freezing when playing online Best game ever..love all the game options..
Good fun,could do with more arcade levels but have enjoyed playing.enjoying the online play now.
Awesome game Feels very real, wish I can play as well as I play in the real world.
