GUESS THE BRAND A very great game, it really exercise the brain and cause you to be more aware of the logos and labels of things and places. I would recommend it for everyone but especially persons over 40 who need to keep their brain active to avoid Alzheimer taking over the brain. A fun game for the entire family.
Impressive I love the way that it gets you thinking all             different ways . Also, is it always good to know your logos                      P.S thanks for making this game because I was supposed to go to bed at 900 but my dad, my twin, and me, got to the sixth level. And guss what We stayed up playing that game till 1000 An extra hour of playing games       WOOO HOOO
Awesome It never lags or freezes. There's not very much ads and the prices for hints and correct letters are very reasonable there was this one game a hint was 200 coins.  Best game ever1
Great App Works fantastically on my LG G3  I haven't come across even the smallest glitch or problem. This game, as well as being addictive, is quite entertaining.
Enjoyable I enjoyed this game, universally recognisable logos and enough obscure to offer a challenge. Got through all the levels without too much trouble, was fun to play with my kids. Maybe could have incentives for completing 100 of a level
Fun Adds may be a tad distracting but free coins and a good selection of logos keep the game interesting.
Guess this brand name I had a Fun cool hard awesome nice time. But to many pop ups.
