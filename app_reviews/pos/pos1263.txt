Well done Tab S 8.4 App is fantastic for tablets. You have the headlines on the left and a nice article on the right.. Where it needs to be. Right on Let's take some revolutionary action and take these parasites where they know they belong..
Readable but Needs option to open in a browser.  Tabs are a good option as well.
Great app
