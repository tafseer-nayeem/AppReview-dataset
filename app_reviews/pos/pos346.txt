Beyond love it Hate you have to buy coins I love the puzzles. I would love to do 2 puzzles a day but it's too hard to earn coins. So I play the free one and when i work up enough coins, i do my second one. I love how the puzzles aren't so hard you have drag out a dictionary or spend 20 minutes trying to Google the answer. The puzzles are simple enough, that i complete them in less than 10 minutes. Good thing, since that's longer than my attention span. 
Daily Celebrity Crosswords Love, love,love it. I love crossword puzzles, and most word games. So yes, you've satisfied my word puzzle addiction. Can't wait for the next one.
