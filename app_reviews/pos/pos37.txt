Love this This is a very easy to use, great app for Xmas fun.  Easy to put together  easy to for for doovers.  I love it
So much fun My dogs may feel it undignified, but this is great. Now to try it on a pic of my husband
I love this app. It is silly and fun and very well done. I am impressed with how realistic the final product is. Kudos
Lots of fun I love this app I did find a free one, similar to this one but this one has more options. This app is great to use on your boss when your at work, it's worth the 1.99
Easy to use Exceeded my expectations, which were to have silly fun with my kid.  I may also sing classic rock lyrics as my dogs on my own time.
Cute, silly fun This app is so fun My grandkids love to see their pets saying silly things. Works just fine on my android  phone and tablet.
Worked flawlessly Galaxy S4. The only suggestion I have for people is to record a few words first, pick the pitch, then record your entire messagesong.  There's a pitch slider for infinite choice but it rerenders the recording every time.
Obsessed I've been making myself laugh with this app ever since I downloaded it. Too funny
Silly cool app Works great
Funny I do love this. Need to be able to choose male or female pitches
Awesome I really have,a funny time making my cat abby sound ridiculous just how do you change the tone or can you not But otherwise its amazinghaha
Awesome I always think I think I know what my pets would say if they could talk.  Now I can make them say it.
Works for Me I love this app. I am on a Samsung Galaxy S5. .
My talking cat Works great my cat is now talking to everyone..
Just fun Does exactly what it says and works perfectly on droid Great app Fun Well worth the 2 bucks
Awesome fun It's grainy, a little glitchy, but it's an app...on a phone.  It's fun and does what it says it will do. Easy to use on all photos.
Simply the best This app rocks. Having a blast with it
