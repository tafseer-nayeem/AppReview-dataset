Rain Radar Is there, you just have to look. I love the new layout.
Powerful Much better on tablet. The wind theme is missing on my tablet, but there on phone. Not too fussed, as the icons on the previous version looked poor on tablet. Does this mean WeatherPro HD for tablets is dead Looking remarkably similar.
New update WHAT HAVE YOU DONE The best weather app has been ruined by your update. It's badly designed and doesn't even work properly. Please, take it away
Great app Ive been using this app since 2010 and its great and very accurate. Cannot recommend it highly enough
I like it It gives you a lot of information and details
Excellent One of the best weather apps available
Weather pro Well worth the price
Love the new layout
Very nice Very happy with this app
Comprehensive, good ux and very accurate Love it, so much better than other weather sites. Nifty little extras which make it nice to use and very accurate. It keeps up to date with latest changes. Thanks
