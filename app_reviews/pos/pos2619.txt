One of the best Baseball games ive ever played on a phone I have a galaxy mega and this game is the s T its not an easy game to play but when you get the hang of pitching and batting the game is fun lets go dodgers
RBI WHAAAAAAT It is the same game we all grew up with Well if your in your late thirties or early forties, you will feel like you are 14 and playing on a Friday night with pizza and friends Today's gamers won't like it. Old school fans will be reminiscent of youth I for one love it
Great game Extremely smooth game play. Simple controls. Not as hard as people are saying it is, does offer a bit of a challenge though. Just the right amount to not get bored or frustrated.
Great game If season mode kept stats it would be perfect. Game play is smooth but a save game function would be nice. If you've ever played baseball video games, it's not nearly as difficult as everyone is saying. Sure you don't strike out every batter or drop bombs every other pitch but who wants that Great game.
Still looking for 6th star Love this game. No management, just play. It gets a little frustrating at some points but overall it is great. Its also is a lot easier to change teams then the few apps that actually use an mlb team. People say it is to difficult, and people say that is how arcade games work but it is not diffucult
Computer AI too hard This is a very good game on my 2nd gen Nexus 7 and my Galaxy S3 however the CPU AI is way too difficult. However I have managed to win games. Also the last update made it better, adding new players and the proper use of the Android back button. But the alumni pack will not sync if you play the game on multiple devices, causing you to pay two dollars EACH time.
