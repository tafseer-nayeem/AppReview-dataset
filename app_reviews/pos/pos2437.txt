Explorers skull island Love it but need more swords
Good It doesn't seem to have anything wrong with it
Great game So much better now you get more free machetes to help
Nice Fun and relaxing
I love it so much and I've got three people on the island I love it I love it so much
Lots of fun I like this version very much. The original was boring and didn't move without buying resources. This game it has a quirky story and good balance. I like it.
Cool Awesome game
Awesome game Play instilled this game. I play it and I can't stop  
Skull Island Fun game
Skull Island The games are all about the same as Shipwrecked,  but they really fun to play.   I just wish I didn't  miss so much due to not having any gold. I have 4 games and I sure can't  afford to but a lot.   Otherwise it's a great game.
Very fun It's like a lot of the other games in a way but I like how easy it is to exoand
Awesome Love the graphics and cute ideas
Feefee Enjoy playing this game
Good game so far
