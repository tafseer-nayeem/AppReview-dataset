Great app I was getting bored with vodka cranes so I bought this app and now once a week I pick out  random drink and have my bartender create it. Gives us something to look forward too.
The best for all I love this application.  Not only does it work without problems, the recipes and recommendations are great.  Sure some are not good, but they are not popular or recommended  Well worth the few penny's per drink.
5 star. No app could ever keep up with the amount of new drinks and new liquors that appear every month.  But this one has a lot of the basics covered.
Awesome I'm a bartender, and this app. Helps when someone orders a drink I've never heard of, or I can't remember how to make

Banana Banshee 1 2oz,Banana Liqueur 2oz,Creme de Cacao, 2 oz.Light Creme or Half and Half  Creme or Half and Half 2 Scraming Banana Banshee 12 oz. Banana Liqueur, 12 oz. Vodka, 12 oz. CREME de CACAO
Good app needs simple addition Really enjoy this app. Like how I can add custome recipes to the selection. It would be a good addition if we could add items to the liquor or garnish database.
Lots of recipies, Facebook share button not working. Large collection of recipes. The Facebook sharing button seems to be having an issue on my S5.
Still the best Had this App on my iPod touch previously. Helped me mix SO many drinks.
