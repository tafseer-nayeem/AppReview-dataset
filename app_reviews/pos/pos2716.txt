Can't upgrade the villages and use the extra power up stuff. I can not upgrade some of the villages because percent buttons are in front of upgrade buttons. The power up stuff are too small for my phone to use. Fix this.
Good game 1 bug I've played this game before and I love it. There's only 1 bug. When I played this on my Samsung Tab 4 10.1 it worked fine, on my Samsung Galaxy S6 edge it doesn't. When the additional content popup appears and I press download it says failed to connect. Everytime Please help
Strategy game This is a fun strategy game. I especially like the multiplayer mode. It's fast paced too. But if you attack recklessly then you can leave yourself vulnerable.
Epic The game is so good I expected to buy the other levels but we don't have to its completely free
Oh the thin red line you tow This is truly a great game it allows the player to ride the thin line of simplicity, aggravation, skill, and entertainment. If you lose it isn't because of some glitch or bug you simply weren't good enough  but you could be. It gives you something to work for as opposed to all the mindless tap games out there. The mission is always simple but accomplishing the task is the challenge, and the FUN.
loved it but sometimes it lags... please reduce bugs for smoother gameplay on multiplayer
