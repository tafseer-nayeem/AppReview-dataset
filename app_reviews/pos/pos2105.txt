Fantastic I've tried many bubble games and they all have boring graphics and this is the best. I had it on my tablet and I was looking for this game for a long time and finally I found it I definitely recommend it to anyone you won't get bored
I drive Amish and it's a great game for my waiting time. Never any problems. Love it 
I Like It SO Much I like this, but there are cons. Ads can be disabled with no wifi.  PROS 1. Good game 2. Zuma style  CONS 1. It's just a wood background, not Indie. 2. No music 3. Tap Limit mode button says Tab Limit  I like it anyway. 5 for ya
Play better If you think it is a child's game, try using it as a challenge game. You will be surprised
Loads of fun Lots of fun.  Practice strategy on a small scale. Ads are annoying.
Excellent I just wish an infinite mode that stops only if you are out of moves
Maze puzzle Assemble colors  and  tab to clear as many as possibility to clear the board.    THIS ONE IS GREAT
