My favorite game Yaaaaas
Great game but you got to figure out how to have it not eat so much data it's a data Pacman also it heats the cpu in my tablet badly.
Full of bugs First, let me say that I absolutely love this game I have been playing it nonstop for over 3 years. I upgraded to the paid VIP version within a week on the free version. With that said, the app becomes less and less stable each time a new version and freezes often. TO THE DEVELOPERS Fix the bug which shows Facebook friends who are playing because none of them really are One is my husband and he laughed when I showed him my screen. Fix it
5 star to 1 star It's used to be a horrible game. Now that the silence has been fixed, it's back to 5.
Loved the game Great game
Love it
Addictive Love this game. Great features constantly updating which is good. Never get bored highly recommended 
This is awesome.  If you love music and think you are better than your friends at guessing the song, step it up and take on the rest of USA
