Worth downloading So easy, offers all the options in one app.  Other apps either don't work or just lackingmissing options.  This is legit and quick to install,  it's the only app you need for print, scan, sharing etc..
All Needs All in one for my work, then how about change the app icon And some UI elements aren't material design, refresh the design into the fresh one instead of Holo will make it look eyes catching
Works great most of the time.  Two different hp printers.  Ocasionally it can't find the printer, restart my phone and always fixes it.  Galaxy s5.
Must have Very useful Save money on a scanner and just download this app. Scan single or multiple pages and share thru email messenger or direct to Drive. Thanks for this App
Puts a lot of printer features wireless I like that I am now able to scan documents and check my ink levels right from my phone.
Scanning to my smart phone Its was better than I expected. It gives you the option to combine multiple pages into a single PDF.
Been using this app quite a lot.  It's so so easy to use that I prefer to use my printerscanner from my phone than my computer.
Scevia Hunt Application works great  I have used it to copy, and scan from and to my android phone.
Works really good It prints and thats I wanted but to print off the internet you need screen capture
