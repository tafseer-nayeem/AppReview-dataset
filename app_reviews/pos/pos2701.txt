Love It Still loving the game. Adding more friends daily. I do have one issue that is bugging me, I haven't had a daily challenge yet. My daughter plays and she's always talking about her challenges and what she received for prizes. I don't have the icon at the top for it
I really enjoy playing this game but it called for an update so I did that. when it was doing the downloading, its taken several HOURS and it's 12 done, keeps cutting out  , than I have to restart it and now it's over 12 later  still doing it Now,  my question is,  I've been playing this for close to 80 days and haven't been able to play this,  am I going to have to use MY acorns to restore my daily bonus or the game gonna restore that for me Plz fix the bugs  errors.
Fun game Been played the game quite a while..fun game and the best thing, its doesn't need an internet.. XOXO
Love this game. Very addictive. I play for hours on end Keep up the wonderful job. Creators are pure genius. Only problems are that it keeps stop working too much. And can't get to most other villages because they are unavailable.  Soccer is over. How about something new so hopefully we can see other villages. Otherwise, thumbs up. Thank you. Its October 24, 2015 and i havent been able to play. It crashes when i tap the icon. Not so much fun now. Candy Crush games have kept me busy.
