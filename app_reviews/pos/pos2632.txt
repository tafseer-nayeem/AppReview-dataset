Great game Probably only because I've scored 9588, but I love the game
Good
Very impressed at how polished this game is. Nice effects, all the right sounds and great choice of questions. Couldn't ask for more
Wwtbm Excellent game no faults
Good game, much better than the two previous versions, but you could of added another achievement like answering all 12 Q's without using a life line, still I like the option of adding more question packs.

Excellent
