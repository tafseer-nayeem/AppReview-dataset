We are just happy that ABCmouse is a go to thing for our daughter.  She very much prefers the app to the computer 
 LOVE IT My 6,1 love it and the kids love to learn and my 9 year old daughter is not leaning good so we put her on it and she said she loves it we love are kids to learn
Excellent game My little one loves loves loves it. Not the greatest app on a smart phone because the screen is a little too small for all the functions, but it would be great on a tablet.
Great This app is wonderful. It's never been so easy to get my kids wanting to learn.
Love it My 2 year old daughter. Loves everything and she is singing better and coloring better to...best thing I brought so far
Perfect for my little one We haven't experienced any of the issues stated by other users. My 3 year old has been using the app for 6 weeks now and she is able to navigate the screens and progress through her path on her own. Very well made and perfect for eager young minds
All of it its helping my little boy learn and pick up on thing that he need for school. .
Awesome Great and structured tool that actuality promotes learning rather than killing time.
My son will literally TRY to throw a tantrum if he doesn't get to use the app. Lol He loves it, and if he loves it, I love it He started learning immediately. The tickets they earn after completing an activity is a great reward for them also. He gets a kick out of those tickets. I am very pleased with this app. Hopefully it will continue to grow and improve.
Nice My son love this He Addicted to it. He loves Playing this everyday. He enjoy learning his ABC's.
