I LOVER Adoro tocar piano
It makes me feel relakes
Best piano app ever The piano master series by b7 entertainment is by far the best piano apps on the net.  Its piano playingfordummies I absolutely love this app and you really dont need music lessons to play this. Its wwonderful to play the only  downfall is it needs more updated songs. And more variety of types.
Most brilliant piano app I have all of these piano apps  The Pro version, Chopin, Mozart and now the Beethoven version  Absolutely fantastic  Teaches you to play and you can listen to the stunning music while marvelling at the mind blowing dexterity of these composers.  Piano Masters are incredible  Buy this app if you enjoy classical piano.  Its great
Perfect Is one if th best practice learning tools that I have found . It helps in gaining a visuals and feel of where the notes are  while allowing a beginner to grow their ear in perfect pitch
Love it . Really good for noobs and advanced. A great way to learn yourself or teach a kid who can't get off his console or smartdevice. More songpacks please. Flight of the Bumblebee
