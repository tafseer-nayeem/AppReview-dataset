Chat wont work since last update Chat just says connecting so I cant chat please fix thanks great app nonetheless they r pretty good about quickly fixing it
I Had To Reinstall To Fix Chat All in all a fantastic app, but with the last update, I had to reinstall to get chat to work on tablet and phone.
One of the greatest streaming apps This is one app that seems to be getting it right. Chromecast support,  easy navigation, and a nice UI in general. There are some minor things missing,  like not being able to announce a repeat subscription, but it really is nothing but a minor detail.  Great app
I love this app.... but it is buffering too much. I hope it gets fixed cause I really don't want to uninstall it cause it's not running right.
Awsome There are no possible words to describe this app. Now i can watch my fav youtubers
New update New update chat will not load mod, turbo, and streamer icons will not show no emotes even sub'd ones... big FailFish
Only thing I'd really like to see is a viewer count per titlecategory.
Great app One of my favorite apps. I enjoy streaming live events. Keep up the great work.
Simply nice apps Now I can watch dota live stream everywhere.
