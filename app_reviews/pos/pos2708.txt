Great Game I enjoy the game. I know I'll be playing it for awhile because there are so many levels. Having the lives helps me limit how long I play. Unlocking the various power ups are helpful,especially as you get to the harder levels. What I especially enjoy is that I can pick between Anna or Elsa or one of the others to be in the scene, unlocking them as I go. I definately suggest this.
One of the most fun  addictive games for Android This is a great twist on the classic bejeweled style games and a lot of fun with brilliant highquality graphics. My only complaint is that this is not yet available for the Sony PlayStation Vita, Sony PlayStation 4 or Linuxbased operating systems such as SteamOS and Ubuntu... Other than that, it's fantastic and highly recommended
Frozen fever OMG I love this game also I have watched frozen fever  and it is AWESOME
