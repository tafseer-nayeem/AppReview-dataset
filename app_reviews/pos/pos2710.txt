Awesome My little brother who is 9 years old loves this game. It has a lot of different little games on it. And it's perfect for him. And he hasn't had any issues so far and this is the second phone I've had it on, a Samsung 3 now a Samsung 4. But I do suggest using Wi Fi to download the game first because it is big and takes forever on mobile data, after that though it's no problem. Also I would put is on a memory card simple card to free up space on your device.
Love it Cool but took all night and in the morning does not work
The best ever ,going  to keep forever

Sweet game I love it .. Now if there's a way to make a game like this for the ps3 or ps4  x box 1.... That would make Lego a mother load of money  just wondering if Lego ever thought of that

This is amazing. If u don't like it your wrong. Also if it isn't working its probably becauz u dont have a good phone

Loved it The people who are stupid enough to rate this app 1 star is so stupid and if u put one star and u don't put nothing then that means you don't know what you're talking about
