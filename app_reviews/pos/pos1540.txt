It need update can't hear so good calls drop in and out but I still love it please update it soon
Outstanding app After couple years using MJ services, finally after few updates I got that I'm looking for.
The BEST around I use this on cruise ships to make free high quality calls and free text messages.  Cell phone service at sea is 3 per minute and 50 per text message.  Wifi service costs about 10 per day.  I get the wifi on board, and I can stay in touch at home for free.  I actually had to send a photo of the ocean because a person I called didn't believe I wasn't home call id on the receiving end is your magicjack number I am writing this review from a Royal Caribbean Cruise ship at sea
