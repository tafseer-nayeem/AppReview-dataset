Great Simple and smart. Works perfect for my nexus 4 device. Nothing to say. It's the best
I have an lg and my doughter loves it bc she can connect the hotspot to her phone anytime
Awesome My cousin was wanting to listen to Kane Brown on iTunes and I was able to download this app and let her connect off of my WiFi hotspot to use her iPad.
Exellent It's work fast. It's simple, I'm able to have up to 5 mobile devices or tablets connected or even a computer to connect to my own hotspot.
Loved it Works great no wifi at my house was able to play xboxlive and world of warcraft no lag at all
Useful Useful with my nexus7 tablet. You need mobile phone data or data period to get it to work then you have to have a hotspot option in the option menu then it's works perfectly.
