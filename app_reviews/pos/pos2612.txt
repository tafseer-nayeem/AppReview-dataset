The game is the very best tennis app in any pad or cell device ever, and whoever really knows Tennis would not complain  about cheating, but rather become a number 1 Rank for over 6 month now like me. Net worth acquired usd 680 Million. The game in hard mode requires more skills which prepares looser like you to be closer to my level lol. Sega, can you make it possible to play online and perhaps make it legal to play for money prizes I d quit my job and be World nbr 1. Lol
Great game but poor multiplayer Great game once you are used to the controls. Multiplayer is bad. If one of the 2 players receives a call game stops and cant be resumed. Also ability to play online vs bluetooth would be great. But still amazing game
Addictive I love playing this game when I'm bored and then can't stop I've been looking for a good tennis game on my phone and have now found it 
Best tennis game I don't know why so many ppl are saying it's cheating, I have been number 1 for 2 months haven't lost yet. I like that tenniel and everyone else is better the higher ranking you are. Just makes it more interesting with a hard challenge. I am Ludwig and have great matches in the final against tenniel, don't hit to his forehand. Great game P.S. drop shot does stink though. They aren't supposed to loop in the air like that they rarely work.
Best tennis game I ever played Best controls, awesome levels... The people who are unable to play just learn it from training and see how much u will enjoy this game...
Amazing, Addictive This game is truly awesome. From the graphics to the smooth gameplay and the multiple game modes it truly has it all. I found it hard to put down. Especially when I discovered the progressive level mode. The graphics are definitely comparable to the version on the Dreamcast. And now it has MOGA support which takes it to the next level. Ok go download it....NOW
