Minor problems outweighed heavily by content Almost any rap song you can name new or old..I like that you can download songs to the app so it doesn't have to stream and you don't have to waste your storage on your phone. Only problem is that the app will crash randomly which is a huge bummer and sometime takes a whole a minute or so to reboot itself. Not any other problems really notable..5 stars even with the one bug, A MUST HAVE
Best app ever Keep it up nice app the only problem  is shuffle play does not work it will pause at the end of song. Besides that BEST APP EVER
Love it Keeps you updated with all new music..just wish you could put downloaded music in cell phone library
Man never seen a good music station ever I'm going to have it forever until yall come out with a new one
need to fix the player, keeps freezing. always have to press play again
Good music This app has great song for everyone youth and even old heads
I like this app but they need to fix the crashing  put notification  disabled downloads for my instruments tapes  singles uploads
Great After update 4.2. The app skips songs and crashes. It never did that before. Please fix
