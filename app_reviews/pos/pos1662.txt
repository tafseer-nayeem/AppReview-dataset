They are a great resource for mountain bikers Get the app and use it.
Awesome app.  Now I can easily find all the nearby trails when I travel and know which to hit and which to pass on.  Makes planning a mountain biking road trip a breeze.   It's awesome to havepost trail status updates so quickly.    I love the trail badges.   I know this is the early phase of something big.  The more people use this app the better it will be.  Keep it coming  SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 2 and IPHONE 4
Excellent If you ride mountain bikes this if THE app.
