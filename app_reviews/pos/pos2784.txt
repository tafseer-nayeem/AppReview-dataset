Excellent educational game for kids Children learn letters in a fun way. The app teaches and reinforces proper letter tracing, recognizing letter names and their phonetically correct sounds, lowercase vs. uppercase understanding, and also how to recognize letters inside the words. Thanks a lot Intellijoy for another exceptional tool to teach the kids
Another quality product from Intellijoy. As always, all at the highest level. My kid loved it. In a fun, yet educational way, the app teaches the names of the letters, proper letter tracing, lowercase vs. uppercase recognition, and even letterword association. Thanks to the developers
