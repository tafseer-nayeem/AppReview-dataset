I like it. This is a great app for news. Not to many ads and the layout work well. Like the comments section, adds to the value of the app. Only wish some articles would not require leaving the app. Yahoo used to be good but the last 5 years has been terrible, glad to see they got this right.

Like it Update A thing I don't like with latest update is when you save article, it no longer shows a ribbon on top right corner. Good App, nothing to complain about. Really good if you already have Yahoo account.
