V02 Watchface Xcellent on my Moto 360
Awesome Looks great, works perfectly
Cool 
Moto 360. This is the first watchface I have purchased for my moto 360. It is completely worth the small price tag and it looks awesome. It has a small battery problem but i'm more than sure that will be fixed in the near future. It gives the watch a very cool look and I definitely recommend this watch face. No faults
Very cool Nice digital appeal with a sleek look. Worth the buy thanks
Great looking Love love love the watch face
Very nice Another top watch face from this dev. The busy face does drain the battery, but what the heck it looks good
Great, little heavy on battery. Cool face, works great, but a little battery intensive if you use location detection.
Update Love this face but it's unusable with the Android Wear 5.0 update. Can you update please
