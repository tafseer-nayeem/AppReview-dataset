Please fix it Galaxy Note4 running lollipop and I can't open it anymore. I guess I will have to play zombie village instead but I like this one better.
Keith Pretty fun game. I didn't know you could get into buildings and such. Should probably have read the instructions to begin with.
LOVE MIKA Purchased both games Battleheart and this one Keep up the ports Make an android exclusive PS If you can make an option to move the action buttons to the top of the screen this would solve some issues with the nexus one, the Acer liquid e and the LG Optimus One. Game still works fine but sometimes the actions get messed up Google Nexus One multitouch issues.
Really Fun This game is a lot of fun. The only thing I would change is the ammount of pistol ammo you get. The pistol is only useful for the first few levels. You get way too much ammo for it.
One of the best if not the best android game I've ever played Great buy I can not recommend it enough
Great A good waste of time It's always fun to try and best yourself. Trying to get to level 80. Worth the money 
Get it. Awesome  Love it,  great little game.  Lots of fun
Loved it it's my baby It's such an awesome game. I just wish it would let me play it. I have played it before and I loved it. It's saying unfortunately zombieville has stopped working
