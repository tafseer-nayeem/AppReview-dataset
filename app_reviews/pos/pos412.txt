Badiya Hassel free appointment booking  a hell lot more.. So far sooooo good Waiting for them to partner with path labs and start offering discounts.
Nice app Where can I find the notifications in app I get sometimes  The ones mostly adviced by doctors on different specialities..
Useful but late reply from doctors. Very useful app. But answers for queries are late. It would be good if we get soon replies from doctors as it would help us if there's some problem.
App extension Nice and please add a screen so that who want blood can contact all the app users by push notifications or so..
Very useful No need to ask people about doctor's feedback..... This app is providing all the information about doctor and hospitalclinic
It's made life so convenient. The doctors on their panel are great. They are very professional and know their job well. Good bye to the long waiting at those money sucking big fancy hospitals.
Smart app Very smart very fast. But more info should be listed.
