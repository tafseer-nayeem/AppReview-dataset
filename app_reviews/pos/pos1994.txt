Brilliant twist on the great game Although I love Monopoly, it is a long game, especially for a portable device.  Maybe I could sit playing for hours, but others won't and this version of Monopoly plays more quickly and has some interesting additions to liven up the gameplay.  I was skeptical of these changes as a long time Monopoly fan, but Millionaires turned out to be well worth the small price tag.
Best family game app Played this game on big TV screen with family and got addicted to it. Haha
A better with update Runs smooth and is pretty fun off first impressions. High battery usage is standard for monopoly because it's graphic intense so it would be picky to put it down because of that. Overall good game. update game has improved a lot and runs even better than before. Don't see how people think it freezes all the time, just reinstall if that's the case.
