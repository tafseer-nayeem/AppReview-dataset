Nvidia shield pro Freaking sweet graphics. No lag works great Keep up the great work. P.s. great updates and editions to the game even better now
Loved it Nothing wrong apart from 1 or 2 bugs and glitches which work and are amazing so 10 out of 10 from me
It a great game with some over priced stuff I love it and the stuff u buy with gems is to expensive try and make it a lot more so u can buy it with coins but besides that its a great game it gives you some thing to do when ur bord and it runs smothly so i say its one of the best games and one of my favorite game on the app store thxs for makeing it
