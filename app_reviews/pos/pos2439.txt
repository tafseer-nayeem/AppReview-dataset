Fantastic This game is awesome,realistic and easy. Makes u feel good when u complete a level   5 STARS
Fun game Great I love this game It's addictive and the features are awesome The only thing I wish could change is add a free mode where we can just drive for fun The other cities are too expensive to open Also wish you could add a inside the car camera I like those
Great game, but... Needs more cars, please There are only 12 cars and it seems less realistic with the small car amount.
Love it I crash inyi every thing thinking in my head these people are really hurt 
I love the game but I just don't like when it takes away one dollar from your money u earned
Awesome I was going to take driving lessons but after this game i think that i don't need to. 
cash money It's so fun and i wish u could play more in my life if i had the time and the ability to do good things in my and i just know whats ahead in life becuase a lot of people have these visions and know whats going to happen in life ahead of time
My story This game is fun but if  they updated it. I would really play this
Love It Just wish you would make it more difficult but otherwise great job on the game 
Awesome  but improvements could be made like cheaper cars, levels ,and online matches.
I love this game  This feels like I'm really driving but moving my hands only
The game is nice but You can give a camera setting just like a Dr. Driving game
