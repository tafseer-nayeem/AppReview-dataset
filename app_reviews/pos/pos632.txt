Hero's Is one of the good ones It's easy to play, people in guilds all talk to each other and plan things in Kiki. You can use real money but if you just play it you don't need to pay to win just play to win. Also the last update was great they really balanced the areas out. Also it's seriously addictive and I don't mind spending time and some money on it like a dollar here and there every couple of months. Sincerely from shadows  clan member.  the
