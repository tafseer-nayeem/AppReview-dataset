Cool It's cool. But what I would add...pls add possibility to make a list of words with translations for one session, and a chance to print it, or to save in wordpdf. It will be very useful for language learnersreaders. Just to have immediately list of words of one chapter, article, etc. Probably possibility to share both words  original together with translation the whole list at once is better. Thank you so much.
Absolutely love this, my only problem with it is even though you rate it, it keeps asking you to rate it again. There should be a way to turn off the pop up. Very annoying especially since I upgraded to the pro version.
Good job Helps me alot during travelling
