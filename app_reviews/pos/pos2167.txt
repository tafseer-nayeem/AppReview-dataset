I love this game Never mind, I found it. For people with applying towers on the bottom row having trouble, simply zoom in and place the tower. I have 3 phones and 3 tablets where the screen fits distinctly differently. However, if I quickly pause and zoom, place the tower, and carry on with the game, no big deal.
One of the best TD's Good graphics, good controls and smooth game play make this TD game a must have. It's extremely fun to play, even my wife likes it and she usually doesn't like to play video games. sgs2 skyrocket.
Incredibly deep maze tower defense I love tower defense games and always look for a new challenge.  This game is exactly that.  Unlike the majority of TD games, you must build a maze with your towers in this game to slow down the waves and prioritize fire.  Very fun.  However, in game music does not work on the Samsung Stratosphere, only sound effects do.
