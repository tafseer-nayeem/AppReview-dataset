Love it Even though i've just purchased this app i'm finding it better than any other google won't let you speak to it this one is absolutely brilliant at the moment keep it up thank you.
Works when it feels like Sometime it will not recognize a word I said, especially while I'm driving.
Really great app Speech recognition is very good and accurate

Shira  Samsung Galaxy SIII Spitze app  manchmal ungenau, was aber an meinem alten Headset liegt  gelungene app,  weiter so x3
The best Understands better than OK google
Better than Siri

Cool
Still the Best
AI Alice
Yep
Settings  awesome The update is great. ... I have noticed however if you turn connect to blue tooth off in settings, when you back out of app setting will change back to blue tooth on. Next I have a gear 2 smart watch and can't get alice to talk through speaker on watch or use mic on watch. I have noticed none of the other assistants have figured out how to do this on smart watches. This would be a great thing to look into because smart watches are being more numerous.  Thanks for all you do
