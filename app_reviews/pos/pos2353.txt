Excellent app Been using this app for about 2 12 years now.  This app is a power house WRITTEN IMMACULATELY Excellent job dev Everything was excellent until my samsung galaxy note 4 got the 5.0 update,  now I get the segmentation error like the others have gotten. I hope this will be fixed very soon cause I'm VERY addicted to MC4SIXAXIS.  I will change my review to 5 stars as soon as the problem is fixed Edit fixed 5 stars now.
Works with Galaxy S5  G900I, Running rooted official 5.0 ROM and using PS3 controller.  Also works with Asus Nexus Player running official 5.1.1 rooted however installing it is a bit tricky and this will disable the supplied nexus remote. Again I'm using PS3 controller.
Amazing Works withe the nextbook Nx700qc 60 at walmart..  My only complaint is sometimes it lags or somthing and it won't release a button press for a fue Seconts but 99 of the time it works just fine
Very useful application I really love this application but do you plan to update it to make it compatible with the steam controller and with scuff ps4
What happened Had this working like a dream now I've updated my ROM and it doesn't work on my s3. Really want to give this 5 stars but until it works I really can't sorry. EDIT for some reason my phone was giving me the wrong local Bluetooth address. The compatibility checker gave me the right address so it's working again now
Works perfectly Wish if this app works on nvidia shield TV without the need of rooting it. Thanks
Great app Love this app, don't use it too often, but when u so it works flawlessly.  Note I have a nexus 5 running android 6.0 and it doesn't work, hope u fix that soon 
Flawless with DS3 on Nexus 5 With this app my DualShock 3 controllers always work flawlessly on my LG Nexus 5. Only thing that could be better is the button mappings on native gamepad mode that for some reason don't exactly map to the button positions on the DualShock controller. Still, great job dev
