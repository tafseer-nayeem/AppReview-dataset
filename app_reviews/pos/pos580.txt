Best antivirus app
Sengupta Very useful
Best antivirus.
Figured out how to uninstall. These guys have given the process in the description. It looks like when you install this app, it becomes the device administrator for your phone as they are protecting uninstallation. Thus if youd want to uninstall, you need to remove this app from Device Administrator  then later Uninstall it. Go to Settings gt Applications gt Device Administrator gt Uncheck Quick Heal  then later follow normal procedure of uninstalling the application.
Best antivirus till date This is the best antivirus I ever had and will renew the license for a long long time. Only problem is that the total package is space consuming and slows my mobile.. can you please make it a little bit compact so that it can be more space friendly. ..
I have been using quick heal in my laptop and mobile since 5 years. My gadgets are well protected.
