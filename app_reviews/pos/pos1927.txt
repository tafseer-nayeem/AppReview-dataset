What a Sequel should be The next installment, to the lifelike lifeline of goat only this time hisher life is in the afterlife and although all seems over this series is just beginning. a sandbox world full of zombies, weaponry and goats. What more could be wanted Gunslinging archery and flying, along with multiple gaming modes all with tones of playtime and replayability. Did i mention a storyline Your story GoatZ's life Well worth 4.99
