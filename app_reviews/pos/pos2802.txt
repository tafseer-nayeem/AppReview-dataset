Was great...Now ruined. Used to play this game all the time. Latest update killed it... Sign in and play records all public.  Sorry, now uninstalling and feel like the money I paid for this prior to the changes has been taken...TAKEN
Awesome, but please add more expansion packs. I test them here and ones I like I by for tabletop.
