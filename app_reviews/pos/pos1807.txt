To delete multiple emails Swipe left edge to the right. Go to Settings, General at the bottom of the list. Go to Mail. Turn off Show Avatar. Take a deep breath and tinker with it. If I can figure it out anyone can. Smh
Really love and like the yahoo mail Love the yahoo mail. Hope they get everything fixed with the yahoo mail and would like to start using it again and get everything straightened out and running smoothly. I have the yahoo mail on my tablet and sometimes it is hard to delete the messages when tapping on the garbage can to delete them, is there any other way to delete the messages along the way. The yahoo mail works on my  cellphone.
