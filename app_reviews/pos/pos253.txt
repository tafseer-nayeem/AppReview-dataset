Update info needed When updated, never mentioned what's new. Please mention it. 16mb download without info is not encouraging.
Just got my first uber ride It was amazing.  Got to see how far my driver was.   Only had to wait about 5min.   The driver was pretty cool to talk to too   They rate you like we would them so don't be a dick lol. Recommend it to everyone.     Shout out to Uber driver Leonard
No need for a yellow cap ever again Great app for traveling to new cities. Ever since using Uber a few years ago I've never taken a yellow cab. It works great, flawless transactions and multiple car options. My only complaint is its not in more places.
