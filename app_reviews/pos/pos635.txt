good Good...wish I could actually won something but my luck always sucked....wish it was easier getting points...but scratching cards help pass time  n the long run I can eventually get a gift card....
It's just fun playing and getting coins. I just don't like the ads it has way too many and they're so long.
It works, I'll say that. The scratch card games are always a good way to boost points for a cash out. My girlfriend played this on her phone for fun, and had made 25 over the weekend without even realizing it. She's now addicted.

 Of u ever get a message saying time stamp is too old. Then make sure the time on your divce is right. In other words don't set the time yourself. The tablet has to set it. Go to settings.
