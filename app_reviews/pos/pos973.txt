It's great I've used it since before when it was text plus. It's great, man. Good call quality. Messages always go thru. You know, it does the job it says it will. BTW, I'm really glad y'all took the limit off the texting. That was frustrating, it really sucked, but I digress. You guys are awesome. Keep on keeping on. Much love and God bless.
It's good to have an app where you can text for free and not use your minutes up. I still love it, but I've found that sometimes the messages don't go through. 
AMAZING This app is awesome it does everything I need it to do... Couldn't be happier I recommend anyone to download it
It's rhe best always there when I can't pay my phone bill wrd
