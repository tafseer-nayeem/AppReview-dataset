Amazing I played this on computer so when I found that I could play this anywhere i instantly got it. And apart from a few adds on the title screen its not let me down. I'm still popping zombies heads off. I recommend to every one.
Much better than the sequel, this game is heaps of fun and doesn't deserve low ratings because of some stupid coin bugs.
Addictive I hve just started playing it again after it took my memory. I just cnt stop playing its already like a drug, I say if u cnt finish a level the more u play in order to finish tht level
