No Tip Needed Overall, the app runs great when I need it to. The GPS works well. It pays the bills. And to everyone that's is complaining about the No Tips policy, well you signed up for this. You aren't being forced to do this job, if you are unhappy with it, do something else. You knew what you were getting into. Don't complain after the fact.
Would like the pin location to be accurate when finding riders. Sometimes it is miles away...
Uber London Brilliant concept but low fare rates ... charity jobs
Driver Have been working in I should be movie I should have been moved by you about the bar on the 5th of December and I'd like to start working for Uber and left so give me a call and let me know what you think about that Ann am now moving to sandiego
Tips Riders want to leave a tip via there card not able to. They wish they could.
Versatility at its best Using this app on my personal phone is so much better than the personal phone and the updated version had everything in one place so I don't have to do double duty
