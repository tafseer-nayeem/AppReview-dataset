Works as expected on lg g3 No any problem since 6 months. I set it to record all calls from phones that are not in my address book an only 4 that I have in it.
On galaxy s6 active Works great, love this for work, life, and business situations.
This is awesome. Just wish I could delete recordings..                                               ATTN ANYONE HAVING ISSUES just go into your actual voice recordings on your phone that is how to see any calls recorded and how you delete them if they don't show up on the actual app itself
Great for Samsung galaxy Tested on Note5 and GS6, butter smooth, great app , it surprised me.. Bye bye Google voice recording, I will test next week, if it has any backdoor for security threats. ...... great and excellent work.....
Great App I've got this for Samsung Note 4. As I've got a bad memory I needed something to make it easier then having to get pen and paper and as you all know you can't always get hold of a pen so I got this App it's perfect for me the times have gone were you need to carry pens around with you.
Didn't work well with my older HTC phone. It works incredibly good with my samsung.
