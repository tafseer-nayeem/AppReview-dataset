Works perfectly with my Galaxy Note 3 and my Galaxy Note PRO12.2.  Both running KitKat.  Still has the occasional crash, but overall works great  AR also works on both devices.  Thanks
Pro version on nexus 7 original lollipop update Now working under lollipop.                            This works really well.  Allows viewing of asm's and parts.  Has transparency and x section.    BUT   The file import and management is awful.  If you have a file manager like ES3 HIGHLY Recommend you can use that to open files from anywhere on your device .
Works perfectly I'm not an engineer, but have people that design things for me and this is an easy way to view progress. Very impressed I can access files functionally through my phone
Great program since Lollipop update. Thanks for the update
Thank you, thank you The latest upgrade now works on lollipop
Tries to open everything Why does this need to open PDFs and every other kind of file
