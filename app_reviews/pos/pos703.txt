Really useful Use this every time I need to draw a difficult panel. What would take it to the next level would be being able to have to models in the one scene, so to have a reference for complex interactions. But still, this app is first class
Very handy This is a great example of how a digital art mannequin should work My only complaints are simple fixes really, options to tweak the skins for different races, some mesh interference when moving body parts interferes with where parts of the anatomy fit together as well. I would also like to see some sort of way to change body part size, including muscle mass, body fat, and as many people have suggested since this is a manga help tool breast size.
Amazing D i am so glad i bought this, its worth every cent.
Awesome Pretty smooth,  easy to use. Just perfect
Can u please add more options like different body shapes and forms
Very useful I'm terrible with proportion, so this works great
Great app Quick reference onthego.
Awesome tool for artists keep it up guys.
Awsome Awsome
Great resource for artists Makes it easy to draw out characters in custom poses
.Manga pose tool 3 D Easy to use once you get a feel for the 3 D movement's. I TAKE A SCREEN SHOT ...then remove the icons from the picture .Once the finger is cleared of Culter l then use another app of choice to add in colour and all the other exters. Art wise it allows me to see quickly if the pose is going to work. A good app for tablets and phones........in my opinion well worth having
I love it It would be great if cube guide and gesture lines could be exported to something like sketchbook. Also needs more anime body types like chibi and Bara.
Awesome thanks Would love to have the option to make the model tallersmaller, skinny bigger
Love it I can easily draw any kind of figure on note 2 by screen capture the pose that I made from this apps. Good job
Skeleton pose tool Any chance of getting a human skeleton model in the near future
