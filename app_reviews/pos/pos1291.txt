Its my favorite watch face now Looks great with full ambient on my 2015 moto 360
Great update. What should be mentioned is they changed the off centre digital clock in ambient mode to centred. It was really annoying previous to this update but now it looks so much better.
Best of the bunch This is a great looking watch face. LG urbane. The functions make the battery last longer than the others in dimmed mode small digital time appears, great work
