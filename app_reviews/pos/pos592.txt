Nearly flawless Like its twin brother Yahtzee for Buddies, this app is nearly perfect from a technical standpoint. I've never seen it crash or shut itself down, and rarely lags, aside from the occasional server synchronization error. As for the game, adding Bonus Rolls to the Yahtzee formula brings out a new dimension, and is very appropriate for an app that allows one to play against hundreds of people simultaneously.
So fun Love this game and it's gotten so much more challenging Good job. I would like more chances at rolls because I won't pay for them, and lots of custom dice choices for like 2 bonus rolls, or easy to get  oh and also more chances to play the towers
Awesome fun Everyday I get my dice on, the tournaments are fun.  Like getting the new dice and I have never had to put money into it besides the full version payment.
Best game ever I love playing this game it is not only a challenge but you get to meet and talk to people from all around the world it's a great game lots of fun.

I've always liked dice games so I enjoy playing this.
Lots of fun. Enjoy the  new and changing games and challenges.Like being matched with other players based on factors including how quickly you play back . Like the new head to head stats
Addicting but yet flustering Love the challenges but hate the wait.
Great way to keep up with people and pass the time
Love this game It's fun to come home from work and relax playing a few games....and not have to rack your brain for the answer...just roll the dice
