No commercials Yay Watching on TV has become too painful with 90 commercials, the same ones over and over again. This is the way to watch if you love the tour. For me the coverage has been impeccable, with no stream outages.
Yay July My whole world stops for the tour. Until I installed this app. Now I can give the whole world half my attention as I watch the race over and over again.
So much better than web experience Smooth, high quality video. Quickly skip to key points in a stage. Loads of extra info.
Great app Dumped cable, tired of getting screwed every month. Only downside was no tour, problem solved.
Tour de France Could not ask for more...great videos covering each day all the stats you could ever want and news galore. And it works, every time
I love the tour De France and this app lets me watch it at my pace
Great app, excellent information. Great app, it provided all the information I was looking for and was extremely easy to access information about stages, riders, and tour standings.
Easy to operate and reliable. Great app to watch the Tour.  It doesn't have all of the extras as you'll get on cable bug it has all of the racing and great info so he as exalts, maps, etc.
Lots of info No one should be complaining about this. Excellent service that keeps us up to date and prevents spoilers. Love it.
Excellent app, performed very well on my 77mbps fiber optic connection.
