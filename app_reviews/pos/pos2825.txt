Great game Really fun and relaxing  Great way to wind down after a stressful day  And my three year old granddaughter thinks its awesome that I have Nemo on my phone
What fun Beautifully rendered.  Nice, but not too difficult, challenges.  Definitely addictive.  Really enjoying.
Simply amazing. I'm half way through the game and love it. I've googled some things to help me out. But the best help of all was when I switched from my iphone to android. I was worried my reef wouldn't switch over. But I emailed them and within a few days they had switched my whole reef same layout and all over to my android. I'm pleased with the game. I wish there way a way to message your friends on there and possibly selltrade stuff from one reef to a friends. Great game tho
I liked it until the game stopped counting my algae collecting and put me at a standstill. Cleared my open apps and it works great
