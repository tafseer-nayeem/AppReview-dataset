I rented an Owner property minus hassles After shortlisting, viewing  reviewing endless options through brokers for weeks, I was at my tethering edge due to lack of accurate fitment to my exact needs despite involving a dozen brokers. Then I zeroed on Owner properties on Rent at my preferred LocationSocieties on this App.Thanks to 99 Acres I have not only found exactly what I was looking for, but minus the Brokerage a definite plus plus
Very intuitive app....quite seemless movement from one page to other....searched for rent...n found quite useful results....can be said as perfect real estate app for users. Map Feature is quite refreshing too
Great 99 Excellent communication skills and knowledge of how to get desired property with peace of mind and skills.
this makes sense love the variety and exposure this app gives, one stop solution for property hunting.
Awesome app for property No need 2 hassle this app do all your queries  verify only genuine person you will get here

One stop property store Excellent  app which met all the requirements.
