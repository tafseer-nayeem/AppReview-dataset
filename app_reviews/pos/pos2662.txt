Fabulous game Great way to keep in touch with family and friends Plays well, though some more common words aren't in the game's dictionary, while other obscure words are. Not enough of an issue to inhibit gameplay. Only improvements I'd suggest are multiple players in the same game and maybe updated dictionary
Awarded. Like Scrabble with friends. Can't figure out challenges though. No where to look. Weird LOL
Brilliant word game Love playing this game and I'm always on this daily. Keep up with the good work 
Challenging others I love to work my mind and challenge others as well.
