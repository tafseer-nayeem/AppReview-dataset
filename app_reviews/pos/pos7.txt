App works great, well worth paying for pro, but please please change the icon as it looks awful in these days of material design.
GOD BLESS INSTASAVE PRO Best Two Dollars I've ever spent 
Yes
Quick fix from developer Great app but crashes most of the time after an update. But the quick fix from the developer proved the superiority and ease of this app over others.
Please add arabic language in search
Does its job very well In rooted and have similar Xposed module apps that can do what this does...EXCEPT this one shows you the pics you've liked and so enables you to easily find old photosvideos and download them. Whereas the others only allow you to do it to new pics you find  come across. Well worth buying the Pro version as you get a lot e features for only a small price.
pros easy to select and download cons  app crashes with no error if there is more than 200 pixfiles in dl queue. it is not possible download 23000 photos profiles or e.g. 200 photos x 4 profiles   1200 photos.   if you clear notifications by mistake downloads stopsdeletedcanceled. no warning etc.  no photo count information about profile. you have to go back instagram to see how many photos are there before start selection.  tou have to preview all photos before select and download. no opti
