App needs improvement but SBI is really good Your credit card service is really unbeatable service as well as the SBI customer support is more knowledgeable and helpful than other cards but I have only one issue that my card limit is still same since many year and my HDFC card limit is more than double of SBI. Please keep increasing limit with the track record of expenses and timely bill payments . Truly love the point redemption SBI has all branded items for redemption.
Wonderful to use Really good to use. The navigation is perfect and payment option are really useful.
Mast app. And best service. Thanks
