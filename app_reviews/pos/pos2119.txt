Good but interface could be better A good implementation, but needs an undo as it is easy to miss click especially when zooming.  The recent bug fixes make it a smoother experience.  Add a one step undo and add the expansions to make it amazing.  
Excellent version of the board game My only quibble would be the ability to undo an accidental move. Otherwise a very entertaining game.
Terrific light strategy Great implementation of a fun game. A bit deeper than Carcassonne, but still easy to learn with fast play. Wish piece placement could be undone, but otherwise fantastic.
Great stuff Graphics a bit shoddy in an otherwise great game.
Good Tutorial I play this on my phone while waiting for the game group to arrive.
Fantastic I would like option to move my pieces around so I can plan on my move visually. I would also love to play the expansions on this app. Finally, I'd like to be able to set up a game with my friends via private network so we don't have to continue playing hot potato with the mobile. Great game.
Fantastic transition This game has transferred to electronic media fantastically. It's a brilliant game with endless playability as each game is different due to different objectives and board game tiles. As others have stated an undo button wouldn't go amiss. All in all a very good game for android and the lack of an undo button doesn't cost it a star.
A good game properly set up. Using a  Samsung Note 10.1 has shown two recurring minor problems.
Very enjoyable Thought this was a great version of the board game. And Ai is not too bad.
Great game Great game, however the gameboard and settings don't function properly on my NVidia Shield tablet. Thankfully works fine on my HTC One though
Finally some decent boardgames are coming to Android
Love this game. Works great. One of my favorites on android. Would love to see the Nomads and Crossroads game expansions added
