I  love  this  game I  love  this  game  because  it  is  my favorite  is  my   favorite  game  ever  than  any  other  game. So everyone  that  is  my  friend  they  can  play  and  I  can  play  myself. Plus  I  woke  up  the  other  pets  all  you  have  to  do  is  go  to  Game  Stop  in  the  mall  and  get  a  10,20,or  50  dollar  gift  card.
Doesn't work anymore I downloaded the basic app with the one pet. My daughter loved it, so I bought the rest of the pets. After a full system update on my Droid Turbo, it no longer works. When I click on it, it crashes in seconds. I've tried clearing caches, data, and even uninstalling and reinstalling. Nothing works. Not sure if its the app or my phone.
