It does exactly what it says I love it when apps work exactly like they should. I needed a pdf reader and hate adobe...this was awesome. Wouldn't mind a 'bookmark' type feature for longer reads...but that's not an issue worth giving a lower rating...

HA having 2deal w ADOBE if you don't pay, u have to email urself our .pdf BLEIGH ...and so Hey DehDay Adobe I kept my monay, don 'chu worry     BTW    Folks that R saying here there's no shrtcut on my homescreen     These aren't BROWNIE BADGES  Ur screen's not a SASH, either ROTFLMAO man that made my tummy hurt from laughing 
Leaner than Adobe, yay I'm happy there is a leaner, more integrated viewer than Adobe's.  Sorry but your viewer has become a bloated platform for upcharges.

Best thing for non standard text I do a lot of copying out of old periodicals, it will often switch e's to c's etc and have formatting issues but allows me to get the bulk of it and then correct it in a word processor.
Great. This a very basic reader but it does the job. For those that don't know there's not a launcher icon, you need to open the PDF file via a file manger.

Changed my life I was addicted to marijuana tokens, but after installing the Google pdf viewer I got my life back on track.
Stupid people, it doesn't make an icon app It's for builtin functionality, so you can click a PDF and open it without a paid app NOT for opening the app itself. Stop rating with 1 stars if you're clueless
Smh at people rating 1 star. There's no need for an icon or direct access to the app. It's to allow you to view PDF when you click on the file.
