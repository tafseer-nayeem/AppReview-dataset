Lily Cakes My daughter absolutely loves this app Just wish they had more for android.
Brilliant app My 20 month old loved it, so much he didn't want to stop playing.. looks like I've lost my tablet to the toddler 
2 yr old's favorite app Great graphics, cute song. Lots of surprises for a toddler to explore. Will definitely consider more apps made by this developer.
Fantastic Worked well on my Asus transformer 101.  My kids love it.  Thanks
Great Wonderful
Perfect for toddlers I live how it gives hints about where my daughter should touch the screen to make things happen.  Bonus points for blocking menu and back buttons.
Great app Finally on droid
Great Love it and want more from them
One of best child app developers now on Android Great to see one of the best developers of apps for children finally on the Android platform. Duck Duck Moose apps often have clever and humorous elements. This particular app is for younger toddlers and is a good first app for them, because it is mostly movement and music based. Park Math and Word Wagon are excellent apps for older toddlers respectively, good intros to math and spelling concepts please bring them over to Android too
