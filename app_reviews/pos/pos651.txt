Can't get 3 mins into the game.. Can't get 3 mins into the game without it shutting down on me. Specially when in trying to create my character. Would like to keep playing, but might not be compatible with my phone.
LOVE IT If you are a wwe game fan like me you love the next gen looking graphics but there should be a sold seprate controler to hook up and there are some problems with swiping but besides that its a great game and thats the bottom line
I think guys should and more type of matches and more titles also more superstars. And it doesn't always respond to my swipes so please fix that. Great game
Must to have more superstars and matchtag team match, Hell in a cell, More move Last rideold school, rest in peace pin, hell gate, etc
WAMSOME Just one question... Where can you do Dean Ambroses Signature like Romans is while they're standing Randys is when they're down so wheres Deans Also if you get 3 sigs but dont use them it should automatically transfer to a finisher. Can you include finishers and signatures to edit so your MyCareer player can have the ginishers and signatures we perfer.                                                             Thanks
I Couldn't Wait To Play It Amazing Everything Awesome SPEECHLESS
