Great game but... Urghhhh I love this game but when the Halloween place was there the game glitched and I missed a whole 8 days if it happens this time I quit cuz I love chimera he is my favorite mythical creature and if I don't get him because of this glitch me and my bro are quitting the game ya its not working for him either
Love it Good fun addicting game I think that there should be a daily log in thing for gems for 5 days straight it we long in in a row we should get some gems and then the final day we like 5 gems and keep getting gems after that
It's a great game to play an meet a lot of friends on hear but I am also playing clash of clans to
Why Why don't you let people save their own progress if it got deleted,but this is a great game I even have some dragons I can't place yet.  This is one of the most amazing dragon games I've ever had
Its fun but I cant buy the starter pack plz fix it the offer is almost gone
I love it. Just make sure you either have WiFi or really strong data. My data is weak so the game lags a bit but other than that it's awesome. I only got this game because Dan and Phil were playing it
