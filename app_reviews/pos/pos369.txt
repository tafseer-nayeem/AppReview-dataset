Works great with galaxy s5 At first I wasn't going to purchase this app because all of the bad reviews but after days of it being on my mind because of my 3 years old son I decided what the heck if it doesn't work then oh well, so I downloaded the game and the login screen let me log his name in and it also let me buy downtown with everest in it. So in the end happy mommy and happy son. Also I have a galaxy s5 if that helps. So glad I went with my gut.
You have to hack it. By hitting done fast when you hit the name tag it will work
It's really cool I loved the pup pup boggy
