Awesome It's very detail, theres confusion its everything you expect out of an RPG base game. It's Awesome keep up the good work guys
Fantastic I dunno why people complain about the game not working, must be their phones are out of date. But works perfectly on my galaxy s6. I love this game, I subscribe to karats every month. DbeAr3291314 is my user name, zerker 450k cp awakened. Thanks for this amazing game
Love it....just one thing I never got my legendary equip or pet....i still think the game is great...just don't promise something you won't do...great game tho
Try to find a way for the pets fight alongside the characters rather than just simply following around...
Update Problem When i Win in Arena, it keeps telling me that I do not have internet connection when I do have. Pls help Thanks
GREAT game I've been looking for games I'll enjoy on here but haven't had any luck finding any. While playing Tap Titans i came across an AD for this game, and I looked what I saw. Once I installed it, I haven't stopped paying it since. Two thumbs up
