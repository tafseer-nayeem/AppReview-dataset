Very very poor service.... App is showing wrong name One guy from your office called me and told me that there is no way to update your name... Wtf was that Let me know if u want his number I will update here and from day one I am the using this number... Just because of poor service I am gonna stop using dhokhomo cards soon... Thanks
Got my refund Really awesome app . With easy step you are able to register complain and really believe me  response to every complain is good . Easy to use and bad reviews are for older version.  New version is awesome
Finally guys did it. Excellent features. The in house Recharge is good. Just make sure to refund the amount on time I.e without a delay, if a Recharge fails due to a technical problem.
Best app for docomo users I dont know why these other user had rated and commented as a not a good app i dint found anything such things, you get all the offers on this app so 5 stars
Love it When people don't know how to use this app then they say poor,worst etc. First go and learn how to use apps.
