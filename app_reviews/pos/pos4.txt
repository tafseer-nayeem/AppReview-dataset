The best photo editing for mobile devices This is so far the only serious photo editing software I've found for editing pictures on the go. It a allows editing without introducing artifacts on the images.
Ace for my novice photos amends Love this app. Easy to use. Does crash occasionally. But it's perfect for me. 
A new feature required Awesome app...but it can become more than awesome if you add a feature of downscaling the picture to reduce noise and hence increasing superiority of the photo...e.g. similar feature used by xperia z3,z2  lumia 1020 ,etc.
Thank you After  waiting for too long, Thank you .. Though its only free version,  but you provide what we need for basic...  There's no need to complaints too much anymore , maybe just bugs small problem... Etc. But you're still the best since 90's... Keep up a good work
Its Pretty Tight Bro Its tight, but idk why I can't save my own presets as filter thing's or pay to save a preset to use over like 5 or so similar images. ..fml
Good blend between Photoshop photo enchanting filters and instastyle looks. This app has basic photo filters such as sharpening, contrast, etc. and some nice filters for changing the look of the picture. Best compared to Pixlr, which has collage maker but this has defogfilter and integrates into Adobe revel. Pixlr in the other hand is more straightforward. I use both for different kind of purposes.
