Nice app One of the best apps for cameras.
Great app Works very well. Compatible with many cameras. Easy to use.
Great view
The ip camera app Switched from the foscam app to this app and the difference is huge. Very easy to use and has too many great features other apps don't have.
Best app I have Works great on Samsung S4. Always improving.
Nice, well done I like it, run 14 ip cameras with Security Spy allows multitasking very nicely done.
Good and trustable. I didn't face any issues. It works and it does what ia supposed to do. I monitor 2 ip cameras from EasyN and functions of this camera can be found in the app.
Last update shows cameras offline, and the app still showing ptz movement and audio. Fix it.
Great application It is really a great application,  and there is a great updates every time, it is very useful, thanks.
Juan Excellent app best one out there
Best viewer ever  Qsee et al should hire this programmer.
Change to iphone Im already to pay for this app on my android,  if now i want to change the iphone 6S do i need to pay again if i still want to use this apps  by iphone
Aspect ratio Please, add an option to change aspect ratio. It is badly needed. There is a lot of cameras with 720x576 minor stream, but with 169 ratio. Thank you for great app Keep it up
Awesome app. Been using the paid version for years.
Why am I getting ads when I open the app
Works Great Loads of cameras supported I love the pinch to zoom you just added Keep up the great work
Good work
Spectacular app Wish the recording part was a bit easier to use but it works.  Maybe it's just me. Love the app though
