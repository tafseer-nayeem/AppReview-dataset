Like it Does not always work.  Have to close out app and then go back in.   Other than that it's good.
Good app Great for finding local used guns for sale. Image scroll feature could be better. But still a good app
Awesome site
Chady9 Great app

Rich putko My region not listed  paid for an app i cant use. Contacted them. Problem fixed
Convenient Nice layout
Great Great app. Only complaint is when you hit show more, it relists the last 5 items for some reason.
Useful My friend needed a firearm. i showed him all those listing with this app and he went for one.
Quite good I am glad that i found it. I was willing to buy firearm for cheaper than market price. App helped me to do it.
good app Now searching a firearm listing is extremely with this app search feature.
Recommended Recommended app if you are looking to buy firearms but feel lazy to go around for it.
Nice design and easy to download App is light weight. So it use low space and battery and don't hog whole available ram.
