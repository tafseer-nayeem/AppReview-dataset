Having fun and stimulating my brain...doesn't get better than that Will advise if anything changes as I go
Pretty fun Glad I don't have to pay anything, plus it's a lot more fun than most other apps, with quite a few different games to keep me on my toes.
I love this application You really should down load this,  Give it a try, you'll love it It really is fun. And it's helping you build a better, stronger, faster thinking Brain  . Its awesome
Killer app Love, love, love this app Definitely a boredom killer.
Great but the directions could be a bit more pronounced like in bold print or highlighted Be creative and loud with the directions because that's where you will either keep or lose people.
Very bad service I have purchased 1 year subscription. After payment all games are accessible for a while. Then the games become locked and the my subscription status was changed back to none and it seems that I have to subscribe again to activate the full version of the program. I emailed to the contact given in Google play with the transaction document no response.
Brain fit Its a great exercise for tour brain, especially if your getting up a little older. Plus its fun
Very Spectacular I can feel my brain connecting neurons. This game is amazing. The difficulty gets more and more intense. Don't be fooled by how easy it may look in previews or at the beginning.
Fit This app is great. I enjoy playing it and the challenges it has to offer.
Finally, a game with a purpose I'm not a gamer, have never been really however I quite like this. It keeps me entertained while my brain benefits from the exercises... I love that
Had it before Rosetta Stone owned it When I originally started this, it was still free. Bow the it been updated and bought to keep it working properly, I fully enjoy it. The games are fun and I love how they slowly gain difficulty. It's a great app.
