Update fixed loading issue Thanks for the update. Chromecast support is awesome. I wish more app developers would do this. I apologize for my fellow Android users that posted really rude reviews instead of just contacting the support team directly, as you advise several times. Some of us can read.
Love it but it still won't load, won't allow me to log in through Facebook and keeps giving me a error message can't download to device nor to SD card. I love game....... but for the last week it won't load my games, keeps saying network connection  required so I uninstalled game and trying to reinstall it but it keeps saying waiting for network connection but I have 4G with 3 bars Please fix soon Cuz I purchased this game and can't play it now.
This Sucks I've had to unistall and reinstall this game 4 times over the last year. It's always trouble with the keyboard. Either there are no letters or no puzzle. I know there's a better game out there...I'm going to find it  I love the Wheel of Fortune game...just not this one
Very fun and slightly addictive      I recommend playing this game with Chromecast.  It's also a great way to get the family together for some old fashion fun.
