A charming, userfriendly app I love this I only wish regular YouTube and other apps had this much charm and personality. The user interface is simple, clean and effective, the little sound effects and personal touches really bring it together. The builtin timer feature is excellent, too. This is very easy to recommend.
No problem with the app, but I noticed some of these reviews and I think it's quite sad how some people waist their time writing a hate comment or being disappointed when they can just be grateful. Some people don't realize everything they have til it's gone. People sit and complain about pointless things. Meanwhile, crisis' are happening all over the world and thousands of infants, kids, and adults are killed.
Do it the BEST you can I really love this cool app it teaches my math she has trouble with. I really love this cool app
Love it I'm not sure why other people have said chromecast isn't an option, but it is for me android, Samsung galaxy s4 and it works perfectly Thank you
Very good my son loves it and to be honest i wish YouTube would update the main app to this ui it is much faster and simple and cleaner than the main
Happy Mom My toddler LOVE her YouTube kids. She easily recognizes the icon from the regular YouTube and watches the videos she likes with no issues. Nothing inappropriate had slipped through, and she has no problem searching for what she likes.
