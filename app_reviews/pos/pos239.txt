If you use the WheresGeorge website why would you not want the mobile app as well  Featurerich, just like the main site and an excellent value.  Highly recommended
Yes, yes, yes This app is a great onthego companion for the Where's George site.  Very easy to operate and love the OCR feature.  The app is worth the price of admission and then some.
Very handy app It's great being able to enter bills on the go, and to check for my latest hits. The automatic zip code detection is also a nice feature, although if you're traveling across zip codes, you may need to hit the Refresh button to update it. Well worth the minor cost of the app
Great Works great on my S5. I love it when someone follows through on  curious and creative idea Thanks.
On the go fun I love being able to enter a bill I got as change at Starbucks as I'm drinking my coffee and then spending that bill not 5min later.
I like it Really easy to enter bills on the go
Well worth 99 cents Simple to use and great for on the go
It makes entering bills on the go a breeze
I like the Where's George app a lot. It is easy to use and handy when you just want to enter a few bills.
About time Took long enough.
Finally an app Fantastic I can't say anything better about the new app Very impressed
Thank you Thank you for the app finally. I don't even care if it works I'm just so happy there's finally an app.
Finally Been waiting on this for a very long time Glad to see it. Everything works fine now
Amazing Loving the picture taking app to upload the letters. Great idea.
Just what a WG user needs Kudos to the site owner for a clean, well designed app. Looking forward to using it
Love it. I have a Galaxy S5, I couldn't get the OCR to work at first. Contacted support. They suggested I restart the phone. BINGO. It works great.
Time saver Now I don't have to wait till I get home to upload my bills. Do it on the go. Hope this makes gerorge more popular now.
