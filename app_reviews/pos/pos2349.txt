Works great Works exactly as advertised. I could care less about cloud support, but its nice for those that do I guess. This is a root app, dont cry and rate badly if you don't have root. Maybe try the free version first.
Outstanding App Superb Tested and it found jpeg, zip files deleted a month ago. Remember this will work best if your storage has larger free space and area occupied by deleted files hasn't been overwritten with new data. Very handy and really works, other apps in the market claim to do the same but are just glorified recycle bins. For rooted phones only. DiskDigger Pro is well worth buying
Finally cloud support
T Mobile S6 Edge Love it
Really good but... I would love the option to search for custom file extensions
Nice I already got the files that I need , I delete it around 1 year ago and fortunately it appears . Great app
Perfect So simple to use
Amazing I acquired a copy of this app  just felt I had to support the developer by purchasing the full copy. Managed to recover important PDF's after doing a factory reset, that I thought I'd never be able to get back. Highly recommended. I can't speak for other people's bad reviews, but my experience is absolutely 1st class.
I love this app I backed up my photos on my sd card to factory restore my phone and all my pictures got formatted on my sd card and i didn't tell it to format the sd card so then i found this app and got my pictures back plus so other pictures that i deleted a while ago. I love this app
