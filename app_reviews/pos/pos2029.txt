Brilliant Tried all of the yahtzee games on Android and this is by far the best. Have a fairly robust criteria for my rating system, and apart from being able to assign names to players, this passed them all. From the authentic baize and different coloured dice,  right through to the suspense you feel as the brilliantly animated die roles around while you await it's score. Fantastic app.
Absolutely love it My favorite game... statistics page needed
Great easy game
Really good game version. Simple and good way to kill time
Yatzee deluxe Awesome game,  love the set up and colors.   I like that you can play yourself or the mobile device ,  the selling factor for me, it's off line and can play when traveling
Loved it
yahtzee awesome
2nd post on this issue Love this game. Everything is exactly the way I like it. My fav is playing against the computer. It seems strange to me that out of the many games I've played, the computer gets first roll. It should be winner goes first. I know you can you fix this.
Love it... This is the best game... I've played it for years.... This display is awesome..
Great game  good upgrade You seemed to have lengthened the undo button thanks The game was GREAT before and now is even more enjoyable. Is it possible to offer a menu option to have an accept button when scoring before it moves to the computer player That way we who have slower fingers could take our time when scoring. Thanks for a great game
Addicted Used to play when I was little took some remembering now it's I  my phone aswell as tablet great game x
