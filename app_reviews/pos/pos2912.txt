Super cute Great for musical kids This is a cute app where kids can make their own dance beats. The tutorial is a must, but once you get the hang of it, there are loads of fun music combinations. It's bright, clever, easy for kids, and is a great app for parents looking to get their children a creative music app
Fun even for adults While this is a kids app, it is secretly pretty robust. I was able to make some cool beats fairly quickly and record the music to a wav file. There's a good selection of tracks to start with, though I would love to be able to purchase some additional tracks in the future.
Impressive Fun musical app. Good music and makes me feel like a real DJ.
Bravo I am no music expert, but I was able to create fun mixes lots of variety and great rhythm.
