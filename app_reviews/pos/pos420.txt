Amazing I love this app so much i use it for every single photo i post on instagram There are so many filters and frames to choose from you never get bored with it Recommend
Good app for instagram Haven't had any of the problems other people have, really good and easy to use and can make an image  work so I don't have to crop it for instagram
So have so much control over everything After finding out that a lot of my favorite photographers from instagram use this, I just had to try it myself. Even though it's 1.00 it's pretty freakin' worth it What you could do to your photos is sooo pin point There are no levels you just adjust till you see fit
Superb App I don't even regret that I paid for this app.Along with VSCOcam it has the most gorgeous effects.It should be also considered the fact that it has amazing Light Leaks and Dust textures but I think this app should move on and update ASAP the fusion optionAndroid users have waited enough .
