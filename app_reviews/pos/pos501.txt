Great tool for your arsenal when traveling Saved us several times last week from traffic holdups. 1st was an accident on highway east of Crossville. Within 10 minutes of wreck, Mapquest detected traffic slow down, I40 had a 15 mile backup that lasted over 3 hours. 2nd was the return home, on our route Mapquest detected traffic backup  rerouted us around Sevierville and to I40 west, 3rd was in Knoxville for the football game.  GREAT APP
I downloaded the app in a rush to go to Union City, TN. We were give 3 routes to choose from I was highly impressed with how quick it downloaded and found the route for us to take. I highly recommend this app for any who isn't very good with the internet or whom is. It's Awesome Thanks mapquest for getting me home when I needed to get there quickly
Much more useful than Google Maps This app is now what Google Maps used to be, back around 2011, that is, full of useful features.  Having realized that Google Maps makers hate the users, I use this more and more.
