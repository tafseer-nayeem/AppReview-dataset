Great Love this app.
Beyond words I am having so much fun.  Thank you
Worth every cent This is my favorite photo app You won't find any other stickers that are as cool and unique as these are Rhonna the women who came out with this app HAND DRAWS and designs each sticker so it's worth the money It's absolutely amazing in my opinion. .. if you appreciate GREAT art and design.. and to have UNIQUE photos... this is perfect 
Generous Rhonna is so generous and her app is my favorite. I love the happiness it brings when I open it.
WOW I'm just amazed. I cannot get over how great this makes my pictures look. All these people who say the android version isn't good are HATERS. Once you know what you're doing, you have thousands of options without having to pay extra. PUT IN THE EFFORT LOSERS I wish I could give 6 stars If this app were a booger, I'd pick it first. Simple and user friendly interface. rhonnaforpresident
Hours of Fun I'm having such a great time with this app  I love all of the options to add inspirational quotes to my photos.
Think this app is awesome, would've given 5 stars if more filters were avaliable.  Thanks though really wrapt with this app
Beautiful and Amazing Love it from the get go.however there are a few features that I can not use because of my android OS...they will hopefully be able to update soon to better support.
Absolutely love this app I love the fact there is a watermarks tool, and you can change the transparency. Also, the stickers are adorable 
I love this app. I use it for personalized cards and to make pretty organization tabs.
Amazing I have used this app for the longest time and I love it And I know depending on your mobile device you will be able to do different things. You can also check out their stuff on their website  view tutorials etc. I use this app DAILY
