Stopped working Great game, but after the new update it won't open at all, I'd like to keep playing so please fix the closing issue
Wow I love marvel and now they make a spiderman game Love it There is only one thing that's wrong with it... One time it wouldn't let me jump, go left, or go right but I still give it 5 stars
Great It's great that spiderman is already my favorite hero so this game is perfect but as of now I haven't found anything I hate about this game.
Alliancesmake them work Alliances are good, but they are not workingnot giving score info. There must be a symbol to show whether game is online connected or not.sometimes after the game, during ranking,it is showing no internet connection , but it is 3G activated.3G symbol is on phone.It seems the above problem is rectified in the present update.Same problem with alliance. Swing is working with a delay.
Just awesome I'm literally addicted to it. Works so great in my Samsung galaxy s5. It's so cool.
Download if you like SpiderMan This game is awesome I played it every day of my 2 week trip to Arizona. Love that you can still play offline although you can't do story mode, and love the variety of SpiderMen and SpiderMans you can collect If you think it's pay to win you're wrong, haven't spent a dime and still got some awesome Spidies. Easily my favorite game to play on my phone.
Marvelous This game is great I really enjoy how you can choose different spidermen and I also enjoy the storyline too.. my only let down would be is I wish it was free roam instead of free run. But besides that it's a great game..
