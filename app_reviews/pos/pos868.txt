Simple Polish and Functional I have tried many personal money apps. This one has an important function that many other apps do not have transfer between accounts. This cut the need to enter transaction twice. I only wish i could sync with multiple device. Maybe to dropbox if developer does not want to deal with the service.  Btw camera did not work, whenever I took a picture the app closed. I use LG G3.
easy to use  beautiful interface

The Best Has everything I need It's a keeper.
