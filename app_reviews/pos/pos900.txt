I use it everyday again after a hardware upgrade I've been using the app for over three years. Occasional bug on update historically but they fix them quickly, not noticed any recently. Good link to the wider info on their Web site. It's the only app I've bought Old reviews out of date because it has got much better
Excellent net based app Works well when you have WiFi.
Great app I use app everyday to track my workouts. Straight forward app. Can't go wrong.
It does everything I need, no problem.
Love this app What else is there to say....
