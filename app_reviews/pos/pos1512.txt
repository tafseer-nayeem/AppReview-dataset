Love it Its great. my phone is actually called Jess and i like northern accent so this app was perfect for me.
My favorite voice Forget the canned voices on your phone.  Replace it with this one.  Realistic sounding and very pleasant.
Excellent Awesome. Realistic. You'll forget it's a tts. Sounds like she's actually reading to you like a recording.
Excellent Now my default voice on an SGS4. It gets quite a lot of use as the voice of my Tasker routines and gives it the character I was looking for.
Voice of my Car I use a 7 Allwin ZeePad as the interface for my car computer and use this voice for audio responses to car events  Works great Makes my old '78 280z feel like a luxurious modern car
Good Voice Works good for eBook reading, also cheaper and naturalsounding compared to other English TTS... ... A bit glitchy at some places, but still ok.
Sounds really good. So far I'm really enjoying this voice. My favorite since loquendo.
This is a great voice. This is a great voice. It can be a little choppy at points but in general it sounds good. Cereproc has great customer service. The voice stopped working with the latest Google Maps Navigation update. I emailed the developer and within hours I had a response and there was and update to the voice in the play store.
Excellent Voice I have a few of the Cereproc voices and this one is my favorite.
