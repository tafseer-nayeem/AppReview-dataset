It is an awesome app and very helpful.  An awesome upgrade would offer the ability to decipher the differnt pad names instead of just the wellhead numbers . Several pads are A pad B pad etc etc etc.  Often times dispatch only has pad names and not the wells on that particular paf
Solid app If you have the API number this app will not let you down. The search by name needs improvement and a RRC number search would be nice.
Works great in North texas But on driving directions it will get you close to GPS loc. You have to look at sat.map to find lease rd.
I've been using this app for quite some time, it's highly efficient. The only change I would like to see in the app is the leases listed in alphabetical order.
Great app Takes me right to my wells
Very handy I love how it seamlessly works with Google Maps. Just make sure you switch to satellite view before you turn onto the lease road.
Works for Me I have been using this app for over a year in North Dakota as an oil hauler and most recently in a dispatch capacity,  works great.  I will advise that you must apply some common sense,  it uses the Google Maps platform on Android and you must zoom in and verify road existence suitable for big trucks.  Sometimes it will route you down a county section line,  suitable for a pickup,  not a semi.
Use it in the Permian Basin Too many erroneous roads.
Great Worked great for North Dakota oilfields. It had every company and well I needed. I'd pay for it again
Works great for me Crude oil driver.
The Best Everybody in the oilfield should have this app. Worth every penny
