Ugly app 1 time my mom payed it and i started to play it but this time when i got back on my tablet it wasn't on it
Great fun, no big sales pitch What more can you ask for
Blaze My son loves the show and the games
Works great on an old galaxy tab2
Blaze and the monster Machines Can you stop the glitch please
Skeptical at first...but loved I was really worried about downloading this game for my kids because of all the bad reviews,  but i took a chance and it works smoothly on their tablets, i think it depends on your device. I also wanted Wallykazam but that one was not compatible with their tablet.  But blaze is a great game for boys my kida love building their own race track.
