It still works Don't worry If anyone's app fails to work, uninstall, then reinstall. U won't lose your stats if u sign back in. I was freaking out until I saw other reviews, and trust me...do this, and IT WORKS. If ur pogo app fails to load past the title screen, please do this, and u will be all set. I thought it was an issue with my phone, but its just a glitch with the app.  Don't u worry pogo addicts All is well
I Love it. I play for hours I Love Pogo. If I could pay for no ads I would but I can't afford it. I miss playing tumble bee to bad that couldn't be one of the Free ones too. Download it Today it's very fun to play Thanks for making pogo Fun........ But it keeps say it stop that it I've had it it's out til it's really Fixed and don't stop working online or offline sorry
Love,Love,Love I have downloaded this app on my phone, tablet, and other devices. I never have a problem and the games are great, it maybe wouldnt hurt to add another game  but its perfect. Thanks for always being up to date and on top of everything  0
