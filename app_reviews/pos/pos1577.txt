So informative This is my go to guide Every time i need a quick reference or just a refresher, I always pull up my app
Rahh Love it
Epic New update made it all that much better. Thanks for adding the current Julian date to the icon. Its just that much quicker getting the right date. MRE menus Thanks a ton for adding that one. Just keeps getting better. Do more with Less Semper Fidelis gentlemen. I use that term loosely Keep up the good work Submitting NAMs for the whole team.
Use on a daily basis. If you're an active duty Marine this is a must buy. I'm a Marine SSgt. and I find not only myself using this app for a quick reference but also my colleagues.  I had no problem paying the 1.99 because it makes my job that much easier.  Who wants to google all the Marine Corps Orders and sift through all that mess when you have all that information at the touch of your fingertips anywhere you have your phone.
Not compatible with Note 4 Please make it compatible with the Galaxy Note 4.
Must have I'm also an Active Duty Marine, specializing in Supply Administration, as well as  Provisional Infantry, and this app helps me and my Marines in both fields. It's wide spread knowledge aspects help with mentoringtraining and boards alike. It's a great tool for Marines and all who'd like to learn about the Corps. Must have Two thumbs up.
Great app Very helpful and useful for quick references
Every Marine should have this app
Perfect for Poolees and New Marines
Great app, well worth the 2.00, enormous amounts of knowledge and update feature so it stays up to date. Thanks Gunny Dunn
