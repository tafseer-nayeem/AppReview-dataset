Love the Star Wars app. One thing I've noticed is that the temperature on the app and on the new watch faces doesn't seem to match. Thanks.   Edit 11252015 Temp on watch face is always showing 34. This is on a Nexus 6 and LG G watch.
STAR WARS AAHHH Neat app with a bunch of content.  They keeping adding more content as well.  It was nice to see this morning it installed a new watch face for my moto 360.
Celcius Love it  but how do I make the temperature Celcius instead of Fahrenheit
All things Star Wars What more could you want
Fun Good fun Neat
