Addictive Definitely smart
Pinterest Well Pinterest was my favorite until I updated it. Don't know how to edit folders. No more pretty folder fronts, just a collage of what ever. 
 yeah It would be even better if I could do everything on here HAHAHA or afford the things I like and stuff lol
Expression without the hassles What I like best about Pinterest is its affordance which allows you to express, and follow others', interests without all the baggage that can accompany typical social media outlets that way I can still have a voice of make apparent useful online options without necessarily providing personal info... not to suggest that Pinterest isn't able to be used in said ways
Just what i wanted This is ine of the best apps ever. Or websites to say so. It has everything. Search what you want you'll have it in pinterest. And you can save them into your device too. Or pin it and use it some other time. Great
