FREECELL SOLITAIRE IT'S A GREAT GAME, VERY ADDITION CAN'T STOP PLAYIN IT....
Well Done I appreciate that this app does not require a ridiculous amount of permissions The app runs perfectly on my SG4 with no problems. Game play is fun and enjoyable.
FreeCell Solitaire If you enjoy playing Free Cell Solitaire in general, I think you'll like this mobile version a lot I only installed it a couple days ago, but haven't encountered any bugs or glitches thus far. I'm using it on a Samsung Galaxy S5. Nice app
Very easy to play. Game statistics are presented  differently than  others  but  it is  OK when  you  get  a custom  to  them.
