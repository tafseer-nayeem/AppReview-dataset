I absolutely LOVE this game but... It is a very amazing game but im worried about a bug ive been facing on and off for at least half a year, what happens is instead of seeing regular images and text I see codeing script, and this next part might be my incredibly slow 4G wifi's fault but most monsters and places dont even show, along with the game not even loading. Thanks  if you are reading this for your consideration, salutations breh's
Absolutely best game for tablet This game is amazing When I get home from school I jump onto this game Events are always on and monsters never run out because you can send in your own designs When I bred my first monster I felt great Download this game,you won't regret it
Great game I really enjoy this game. It's fun. I need stronger monsters for war. More runes too. We have gotten a runes dungeon now a few times and it helps to accumulate runes to strengthen the monsters.
Awsome This game is a fantastic game im ratinging it a 5 but it needs to slow down on gems like u can buy a kit for 225 gems but when you try to buy it , its like 15.05 cash like the heck but i lovw this game rate it to 4 or 5 youll love it trust me
Stuck in place I'm stuck every time I get on I have the same egg in my hatchery and I have to rehash it,and every time I try to collect the puzzle piece I'm still on day 3 for some reason I am stuck in place. Is there any way you guys can troubleshoot and fix the problem please
I love this game so much This game is amazing They add new monsters every update. One of the newest monsters is r.o.f.l which made me rofl. But besides that this is probably one of the best if not the best game I have ever played
