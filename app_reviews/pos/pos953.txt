WHERE'S THE TEN STAR RATING OPTION Wow, I have been looking for an app that lets my device become a monitor of what is shown on my PC   I have never heard of iDisplay and DATTA is very pleased  He had a small prob installing the pc tool but it now works like a charm
Great App I didnt think something like this was possible but it works really well on my lg g2 on both wifi and usb, I even managed to get a dvd to play on the phone screen from the computer, its not perfect but I still really liked it 
Good for desktops I've just got this on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. The connection between the desktop and the tablet is really fast our wifi is very close, near to the desktop, and strong. The only real issue is the lag when watching videos. I think for if wantingneeding another monitor I think this is for you, if your wanting to use iDisplay to hold a still image or something that is still, otherwise wacthing videos on iDisplay is hopeless.  Hope this helps.
