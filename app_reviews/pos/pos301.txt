The game changer... This is practically the standard and now I'm glad I was there and on top of it when it came out....I feel old....
Great game Plants vs zombies 1  2 are my absolute favorite games My only question is when can we expect to see a third one A
Addicted I started playing plants vs zombies on pogo about two days ago. I never understood or got the point of it, and thought it was a stupid game till i started playing it. Now im hooked and cant get enough of it Works beautifully on my lg venice. Couldnt ask for anything more.
Fun 4 All It is a great smooth running application.  I haven't run into any issues of any kind while operating the app. And of course it satisfies my nostalgia with this wonderful throw back to when I 1st started playing this game in 2010. Thank you PopCap.
Best game ever It is awesome I have been supporting this game for years I got the card to buy it and first things first I'm the real lest sorry lol just had to do that but once I got my card. I got this game and before I did I deleted EVREY thing and this was the first thing I bought ever in my life and so I made sure it worked   PS love this game     
Very fun kills a lot of time I work security and playing this game kills time for me Soon as I know ill be going home thanks to a good game that never gets old and kills a lots of time
Brainss... Wow amazing but I got number 2 first and the plants seem realistic but in number 1 it does not look so realistic but its still a great game and I also got plants vs zombies garden warfare but its way different than the other ones and I have no problems with the game its always up and running.
