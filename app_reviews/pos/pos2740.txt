Superb The next best thing to MONKEY PRESCHOOL LUNCHBOX... I highly recommend everyone to download this app...
Super why My 2 year old loves this app he asks  to play it everyday.  He does ask for it in Spanish  a lot too...wink wink 
3 year old loves it My 3 year old is pretty bright, and she loves super why She found the game and it was a fight just to get my phone back lol.
Excellent My son is 13 mnths old and it's his favorite tv show to watch 
Super why to the rescue With the power to read I can change the story and save the day
Great, legit Love that it doesn't want to go into all my phones data, or put ads on my home screen, i wish there were more games like this for my son. I've had other games, and i notice he gets into the ads. Don't like it when an app wants to take over my phone. Thanks dev.
Loving it An excellentfun way to help develop phonics
Great game My 5 and 2 year old love this game
Great for toddlers My now 3 year old loves this app. He's been playing with it for over a year and he is learning from it.  He's now writing his letters. Best 3.00 I ever spent
Warning If you uninstall Super Why PBS Kids it beaned up
My kids love the show and live this app. They learn so many things and I think it's very much worth the 2 bucks.  It also keeps them busy when u have something else to do.
