Awesome app. Firstly I thought that it's going be those apps with fake promises or lots of ads but this one really works. It has got all the books starting from class 1 till 12 and lets you download them for offline reading as well. Awesome. Thank you very much.
Excellent app. The book PDF downloads are fast but inapp views are slow in loading so I stuck with the download option for the books I needed. This is also better for me as I can transfer the PDFs to my laptop for better viewing.
Superb idea Ms. Smriti Irani... it is d best thing one could do.. no need to buy now... cn study frm here only... Thank you so much..
Remarkable Though some of the chapters of biology cannot be downloaded I'm  enjoying reading others. Its the best app for the students so far designed.
Awesome app Keep it up...awesome app,with user friendly scrolling options
Since no such app was launched yet which can be considered to be the carbon copy of ncert . but this app fills the empty glass. But some problems can be observed in this app, some pages are not being displayed
Best app This is the best app even for cheating during an exam and in no light you can study from here.. Download chapters and see them in Phone or SD card storage So that no add can come. Love it 
Thankyou so much....wonderful app This app is very useful....m really fond of this app...thanks to its makers for understanding the requirement of people like me...it made study of ncert easy as it is not so easily available to everyone in my town....
Secret of my success I m in great difficult when I don't get the ncert books in my language but now  I m very happy to get all books in my language....and with the help of this app i saved my time also....
Thanks alot This app makes appstores worth browsing. Thank you so much to the develepors
BEST FOR STUDY 1 to 12th I like it very much for all of you because it  is the aaps which I find. Exam no tension. For bringing books any where
