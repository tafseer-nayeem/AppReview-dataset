100000000000 99999999
The missin with the bug monster that had flying tentacle things with needles is sooo hard.. other than that great game
It's awesome I mean, I know crimson typhoon has 3 arms, not 2, but it might be in the past to the film. THIS IS WHY IT HAS BETA MISSIONS, PEOPLE I personally think it's a bit repetitive, but it's good Also, I did a glitch where Tacit Ronin has his Ultimate Ninja skin. He actually disappeared in the end cuttscene XD
Oh yaaaaaaaaaaaaa I love this game and i dont care if crimson typhoon has 2 arms, and i like the graphics
I beg you to get this game Game is awesome Mission 18 is kind of hard, but I'll get it You should tooooooooooooooootally get this game
