Challenges Lie It says I don't have to complete Challenges in one run but after one run, it starts over Please fix
Not right Not right to  make people pay for what we think is a fun cool game and its all glichy and force closes fix asap
Good fun little bit repetative A solid time passer for Ninja Turtle fans. Easy to play and has lots of upgrades you can do which gives it replay value but it can be a bit repetative. Wish the different weapon upgrades actually did something different not just look different. And wish there were different baddies to play as like maybe ...Shredder And why when you play as Dogpound hes riding in the shellraiser But casey gets his own motorcycle What the shell
Love Casey but Every since I downloaded this game lots of glitches and challenges keep you saying you don't have to do it in one run but resets afterwards also can you please give Casey another weapon with a original Turtle Time he is just copying Leo and Donny it looks cool but Casey is more than a poser and can do his own thing and please if you do this add the tazer in his glove please and thanks for listening
Tmnt I played this game before kids should download this game if kids download this game and get mad because they are losing they are lame.and Danny there   is no blood on The game stupid
Awesome Although I have had some problems with it the first time I reinstalled it and it seemed to solve my problems. Although I still have problems with I still have problems with entering the streets and getting turtle time I always end up spending 3 mutantage because I always get turtle time no the streets. Other than that its pretty awesome
