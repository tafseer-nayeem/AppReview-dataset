Fun game To just play the levels is fun. I've read other reviews about the scoring and what not. But just to play to complete a board is all I care about. If I get bothered too much I just advance to the next and come back later to one I couldn't complete.
Fantastic and quick Has a Great start. Simple and works you into more difficult games. Gives you a simple back arrow for prior games. No undo button but shuffle.  Makes me think a bit more before deciding my move. Doesn't kill my phone battery or make my phone hot. Simply works great.
Great game Just like a previous one I've played. Bought the full version to avoid ads. Worth it.
Challenges on eyes Can't put it down
Lot of fun to play when you only have a short amount of time.
Great fun. Morish.  Just one more game.  There is a need for strategy not just luck love it
Don't play..... unless you have plenty of time to kill
