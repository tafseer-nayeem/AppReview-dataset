Just bought the game, pretty good. But I always lose the round if I don't use college, spinner is useless. But my phone is a lot more faster to be overheat.
Amazing This game is brilliant, keeps me entertained for ages. Really fast and the graphics are good too
Excellent value Loved this board game as a kid. Only played 3 quick games in last hour since downloading, but no lags or bugs. Played 2,3 and 4 player matches against computer n all ran fine. I did win all 3 so I difficulty setting may help in an update. But to be honest I paid 2.49 happily for monopoly and would pay the same for this. Would prefer profiles though were you can name the player and pick an Avatar... as well as a Top 10 wins page for bragging rights lol
One of my favorites I loved this game since I was only 11 but could not get it but now I have got it
AWESOME I knew this game ever since I purchased it on my 2nd mobile phone, Sony Ericsson K810i, in 2008. Now, I've just purchased this game  installed it last night on my latest smartphone, Samsung  Galaxy K Zoom. 
I'm having so much fun with this app And it being priced 34p is not over priced
really cool But needs to be faster when others take their turns, you get bored.
