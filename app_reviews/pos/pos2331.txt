Perfect It's got everything, however I'd recommend a few jazzy sounds to go with the boom bap. There should be more crunk elements and add some trap elements, too. A nice J Dilla bassline will make this complete. Btw my beats have been saved but when I press export to mp3 nothing happens. There should also be an option for me to share my beats. Nevertheless this app still deserves a five because every app is never complete without updates.
Gracias for the love of music This is the best beats app I've ever seen and played and I've owned my fair share of kaossilators among other beat machines. So much inspiration in this easy to use app. Don't go changing on me Perfect.
Hiphop  pads It's  a  little  bit  too  hard  but  I  will  get  better  at  the  game  if  I  can  see  the  beats
I'll give it a five because I like the drum loops , it's not a mpc but for someone who wants something to play with , it's kinda cool.
Great I'm a good exceptional rapper I take it seriously and like to use special apps too help me prepare
Nice Cool beats. At first I thought it was ok but that's because I didn't know how to work it. And now I do and it's awesome
