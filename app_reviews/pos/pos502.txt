Awesome Ive had and have many apps of this nature on several devices when it comes to quality, currently updated movies, series and accessibility this is truly one of the very best in my top 3.

Only One Problem Love it, So far this is the only app I've seen that actually let's me look at anime. But when I watch an episode of any anime it randomly goes off, back to the episode list. Is it okay if you fix this bug
Great Kinda laggy but hey it's better than waiting a year as a non premium user on crunchyroll...
Amazing now Get to watch my favorite anime and it now freezes less Much less I can actually watch things now
