HOPE THEY MAKE MORE MICKEY GAMES JUST LIKE THIS Its such a cute game. It taught my boy how to count his first numbers. But, I wish there was a way to get more adventure readalong games with Mickey just like this. Please Disney, make some more and I will buy them
Mickey's wildlife count along Hard to find something that teaches but is still interesting. This app is colourful with many loveable animals. Easy to follow the different scenes and tasks. Well made.
Okay Its short but I believe its worth 99 for my 3 year old. She loved it.  You can not beat it for the price they have it at not. 75 off
My son loves it It works great on our tablet. Since installing it is all he has played. Watching him use it, it looks good and is easy for him to follow the instructions.
My daughter loves this app. She isn't even 2 and navigates her way around perfectly. She as learned so much and more.
Great game for counting Finding good games for kids is not easy but this one is a great find
Must have for your little Mickey fan Very well polished app. It's great on your phone and even better on your tablet. The details are well planned with puzzles and activities keep your little one exploring for a long time. I'm so glad that I got this app , my son wants to play it every day.
Great service I battled for 2 days to download this game. The tech support replied to my email regarding this matter in a reasonable amount of time. The game has finally downloaded  works perfectly. My son played it last night. He loves it. He cant put the phone down.
