Shopkick kicks  I love shopkick it's fun to walk around with my mom and just scan products haha. I am excited to keep getting kicks to see what I want to use my cards for. Thanks for being awesome and creating an awesome app 
Think it's kewl... Like it...but haven't had long so will see if u actually get cash outta it.
Winner I started about a year ago and loving it. Mostly use the points to get free movie rentals from red box. Defenatly worth it since half the stores I go to anyway. Only complaint I do have is I wish it would take into account what state u live in. Lost out on 200 points because the store in the state that i live in doesn't sell wine.
Great Love this app.  It makes window shopping fun and gives great rewards
Savings Fun app. It really works.
Best Buy No kicks at the Best Buy entrance and I walked the whole store 3 times Sent a email about not getting my kicks. Thank you for the kicks
Just beginning with app Seems to be working ok,will post update once I use it in stores
Highly unsatisfied. I used to get surprise kicks every day I logged in. Don't anymore. And I've been walking into stores on not getting my walk in kicks. Highly unsatisfied
Love it Absolutely recommend this App if you like saving money and scavenger hunts. Does not always work properly but when it does its exciting.
