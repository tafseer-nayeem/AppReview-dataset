Love It I got the other what if but it was  to inappropriate  so I was lucky enough to find this version and I saw what you did with the questions you just use the same ones but make them appropriate  for kids
This was enjoyable I'm glad this exists, to be honest. I'm a kid, and I kind of like the questions. If you like this kind of this but the original is too... grown up for you, then this is for you
This was a trick This is a great game I love how it tricked me
Funny This app makes me laugh way too much, totally worth every penny D
Family Fun I like that I can play this with my kids and we all get a good laugh.
Brought here from the question about making three kind app developers happy 
I see what u did there Ha ha I liked how your question asked if u would like to make game people happy by giving u a high rating  p.s. I hope I made u happy
