It's way better than I expected Good graphics,  good physics,  no annoying ads, addictive, possibly the best time killer
Best time killer best time killing game. simple game but u cant beat. i like it very very much
Great game idea for a few people to play ifferent challenges that keep me on my toes I play it with my niece
Fun but hard The game is so fun addicting,the ice cream mania level tho....SO HARD,Three little cooks,ALSO VERY HARD

Hard levels to beat Very addictive fun game to play. Never seen one like it
Addictive but can be really hard It's a neat little game, lots of levels. Easy to do poorly, hard to get 'S Rank' on most of the levels.
So much fun But I hate that u can't quickly repeat games
Loved it It's very challenging requires your brain you got to download it
Love it I love lt but the crazy jackpot rush is hard and bad boss dart is hard but this is super fun 
It was awesome They should get a Q to past 2 levels
It's the most amazing game I'd ever played

Challenging A simple but challenging....time consuming game
