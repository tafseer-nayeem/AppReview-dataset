Great Game Love the Game, however I do have some requests. Set a higher money limit to extend the game time out more and a more difficult AI, the AI settings don't seem to change the computers choices or your luck doesn't seem to change much. Would just like for a bit more of a challenge. Overall Great Game and Great Game to kill 15 minutes on your hands 
After update After update this game crashes doing the loading of tge game.  I have a Google nexus 7.  16 gb
the wife and I Great game. Would recommend a unlimited setting where you play until everyone is broke with the exception of one person. Great game play seamless on both our devices. Keep up the work. We'll worth the pennies.
Love it It is the best and is way better than the old one. I would recommend it to anyone. I give it 100 but the computers need more interaction with the players. Like it needs to be able to trade and not be able to cheat.
