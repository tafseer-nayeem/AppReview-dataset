I love the strategy It's immersive and time consuming, everything I love in a game
Easy to learn, complex enough to keep you playing. The graphics style has a cool tronesq thing too
Great game This is a really fun game to play the only thing that bothered me its not kind hard to move the camera around
Great but needs improvements It's a great game. A little hard. It would be nice if the troops actually looked like people so it would be easier to tell them apart as in which troop has the shotgun and which has an assault rifle , maybe it can be in a future update
Is really good But I bought the sniper squad and I think they deserve a buff because even in a tall building they take forever to kill a zombie even though they are so expensive.
I was right I knew I would love this game and I do. Keep up the good work
Hard at first but then you pick it up. Love the game
Awesome It's itchin' my need for a good solid zombie tact def game. Gimmie some challenge levels though
Better Than PLAGUE INC. Best game I've played so far besides terraria
10 out of 10 I wold love to see more vehicles like helis and it would be nice if you had simple.character models they dont have to walk but it would be.better than arrows once agian thank you for this amzing game
This game is amazing although a few areas need some attention
