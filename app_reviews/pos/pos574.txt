Picsart Hi its semaJaeeaJames i was looking in on you guys sponsoring me i know its a lot but not for you guys to give me anything just to have your company as a person who loves my work.
Great This app is great I downloaded this app from long ago,and sometimes I delete it for weird reasons but it would be great if you add more clip arts,add makeup ability,and change the wallpaperbecause it is very old and thats it With all these things it would be greater but I will rate it 5 STARS
Awesome app Awesome app but sometimes it hangs and doesnt work properly as i read here can be solve to clear the cache i wud try...i havr been using it for 3 years but not found it as populer as insta but despitr of it has awesone edit settings....good app
