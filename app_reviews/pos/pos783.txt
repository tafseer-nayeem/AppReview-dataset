Nice work Need to add rest of Apps like Instagram,  twitter,  Whatsapp, Clash of Clans the game
I am a reliance user, and it is real free. As long as you only use this apps alone, not with another apps that use internet dataplan. I like the idea. But i am too often too switch sim card. In Indonesia reliance sim card is only Telkomsel and Indosat, i try a long time a go to send a request to add 3 from hutchison and AXIS sim card but it seems no progress at all. Please add kaskus as a free site too. Thanks a lot facebook.
