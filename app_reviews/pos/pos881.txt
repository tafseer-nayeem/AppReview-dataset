Useful caller lookup feature The ability of it automatically looking up callers for me is really nice. I can now identify which one is spam and business and people otherwise. And it works on top of the default phone app which is nice. I recommend this app for anybody looking to make their callers list more readable.
I am loving this app It tells me about every person which is not in my contacts list
Missed call counter not clearing Missed call counter is not clearing until I open the stock dialer app. This should not be needed. Will give 5 stars if this can be done through this app itself.
Love. Great app. I love it. Has been of great benefit to me. Now I don't worry about scammers calling me with fake identity. However, you guys should merge this with TrueCaller instead of making users to download the two apps in one phone. Occupies too much space. Thanks.
Excellent This is a nice Application far much better than similar applications including Trucaller
A must have Very easy to use and don't let no one call you unknown
Know who is calling me and I can see if they are sales people
This is the best app ever. Helps to identify the caller  before I answer
Multi Window Would be amazing if this application supported multi window for TouchWiz. Please do that. 
Lovely It really help in who called u even if u the have the contact on ur phone.
Awesome Awesome app. Helps me ignore spam calls and insurance people calls.
