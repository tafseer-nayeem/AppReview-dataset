Always worked for me. Not sure why other people complain about this app I have been using Google calendar for several years now,and it has been a life saver. thanks google
Functional  Beautiful design Really like the layout, functionallity includes everything you 'd expect. Love the little things here  there too when I added a reminder for a sailing trip, Calendar automatically added a joyful nautical background Small things adding up to a great experience
Does everything I need it to do, even uploads a nifty map or image of the place where the event is taking place whenever I create a new one with Schedule View. Also, it works with most other calendar apps.
My first choice This is my first choice as far as calendars are concerned. When you set up notifications, it actually speaks what the notification is so if you have your earpiece on you dont have to look at your phone to see what event is coming up.
