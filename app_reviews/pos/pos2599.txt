Connection Takes forever to load since last update. One day gg will do an update that doesn't mess things up.
Why I have been playing this game for years and spent loads of money on it. Since the last update I have not been able to play. All I get is a message saying that a newer version is available and it has not reached my play store I am using a new Sony Xperia M4.
Awesome game Each time it takes 10 min to load ..... just the same way when i started for first time...... please fix it..
Awesome Got this on the computer and its awesome on the computer I'm level 46 and I'm called dragonfighter11
Suggestion Hello. I really love this game. it is so addictive. I just want to suggest you guys to add Arabic language, because I told many of my friends to play this game but it was hard for them to understand the quests, and everything because they only speak Arabic, so I am telling you if you need more people to play your game, add Arabic language, and we Arabs love these strategy games. And if you need any help about Arabic language just let me know.  .
