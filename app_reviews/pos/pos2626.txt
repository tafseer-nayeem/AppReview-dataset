I really love this game because first of all there is a wide range of events my passion is track n field and it just a great game
Perfect Really fun, addictive, and hilarious. Wide variety of events and playing types. Although it would be nice to name yourself instead of just 'player 1', still a very good game
I love this game so much  I play it every single day  U should all try it 
Great The app is great. I would only suggest adding the 200m dash and the 4x400m relay. That would make the game 6 stars.
Perfect No lagging or buffering so smooth
Awesome Cool
PLEASE Put 200. PLEASE PUT 200. PLEASE
Loved it
Love game
Best Best track game ever
Tek Cool for a game

Worth the money This game may not have all the events available on other games but it doesn't have any problems with downloading and using that I have discovered. It is fun and worth the money.
Great You should add women sections and also the 200m dash Make a winter games edition
Excellent Track and field lovers will love this game you're on the track even when you're not in the track great way to stay in the competition
Its funny games Its funny game.maybe tje graphics need to be better again
Overall this game is pretty spectacular, very easy to manage atleast for me. However, the 200m and the 400m hurdles would complete this game, can you please create them Thank you
