Great app I don't know why so many negative comments. I used this app all season long  it worked perfectly. I love that it reminds you when the show is on. Voting is super easy. Every feature worked perfectly for my mom  I no issues at all Uninstalling now until next season. Thanks developers for making a simple, practical, useful app 
Ed and Ann Young I have not yet been able to use the site because we have to watch the recorded program. HOWEVER, want to say we love the judges and don't envy the tough decisions they have to make. Howard Stern, we love your familyfriendly sense of humor and your concern for the feelings of the contestants. We hate it when people are told their act stinks, although a very few of the acts do stink. Howie, we love your sense of humor too. Out of words
This is the best and calls you when the show is going to start.  While you're waiting for the show to start it gives you up to the minute information  Oh, yeah... to make sure it works, SET THE TIME     ,  I live in California  and the  time zone  is with Arizona.
Why some people's app isn't working Unless you live on the east where it's tape and live. Remember NYC is an hour ahead of us. The only people that can vote for the Dunkin Save are people on the east coast.
Love it But I have some suggestions how bout you pick a judge and tap them to activate the buzzer
Great I love this so much, makes it easy to vote and super fun to use when watching the show
Its great I love getting to vote for the act and also just in case if you missed the show and don't know who goes thru just check the app
