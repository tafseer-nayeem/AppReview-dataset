Fun Finally a lacrosse game It's fun yet hard. Don't get your hopes too high up and imagine this to be the Madden game of lacrosse, but its still fun.
Love the game, play the game. Love Lax. Played Lax, Still play lax. Why is everyone African American Not that it's wrong. But people would question a NBA game with everyone in the game being Caucasian and looking like Jerry west
I love it hey, I'm a coach for Army of Darkness I  Richmond VA and we donated to the console game, shouldn't it have been released by now what's the story
Needs a update From what i heard the update comes this month but a overall great game when you get used to it
