Awesome and very useful It works very well for me and I haven't had a problem since I got it. Heads up though, if you purchase any of the packs and either uninstall then reinstall the app, or download the app on another phone, you are going to have to repurchace them, so just watch out for that.
Keep crashing I give 5 stars cause I love the app and it used to work really good but now it keep on crashing like everytime I open the app it says followers has stopped so yea it would be perf if you could fix it... I have a samsung galaxy s4
This App Is Flawless I thought at first it would be crap but it's genuinely surprised me Amazing App
It's great I had bout all the packs on my ipod 5 and I recently got an android and I don't know how to get all the packs back
Error I Keep Trying To See Who Unfollowed Me But This App Doesn't Refresh And Keeps Saying Error  Please Fix This App.
