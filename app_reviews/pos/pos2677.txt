Fun take on Boggle You want a straight up word search game with customizable letter die colors, background and NO FREAKING PERMISSIONS Get this game I wish this game was available before I wasted money on Ruzzle Oh, it senses input better and appears more forgiving than Ruzzle, too
Exactly what I'm looking for I tried another game like this but it wouldn't even let me play at all without creating an account or signing into the game using Facebook. I have no desire to play any phone game as multiplayer. This game lets me set the board size and time limit and get right to it.  Good stuff
Wurdle Rocks I looked everywhere for a good word game. Glad I found wurdle
Challenging Really like the game.  Keeps you working to try to find as many words as the program finds.
Fun game, no special permissions If you like Boggle or Scrabble, check this game out.
Tegra tabletgalaxy s4 Awesome on both devices
Excellent A great game and the developer responded to my questions very quickly.  I cannot recommend this game and developer enough.
