Love the game I love the update, my only complaint is that the main screen no longer tells you if you have completed a puzzle already. After doing a lot of puzzles, it's not always possible to remember which ones you completed or paused midway through. This is especially annoying when doing searches and then having to scroll back through a long list after backing out of a completed puzzle.
It's an amazing app
Amusing It's a great time killer 
Love this game Great quizzes. Keeps you thinking. A huge variety. You can even make quizzes. Wonderful.
Sporkle Introduced to sporkle back oh 7 years ago and fell in love with all the fun quizes. Haven't quite explored the app version yet but I just like taking the quizes.
