Great app Works perfectly with my 2015 Chevy Sonic. It's pretty cool. The only negative was the initial download. I wasn't at home and it took too long to download. When it finally finished, it didn't install properly. So, I waited to get home, uninstalled the app and installed it again from a fast network and it worked. No problem since then.
App works beautifully in my  13 Chevy spark full screen loads of different directions and information I really like this thing Just go ahead and try it I used it on htc 32 megabyte phone. I like the turn by turn voice directions also although it seems a little low and I'm learning to work with that
I recently got this app because my new Chevy, it worked great for 2 days, after that it would never connect again and says app not installed on my car, I'd give more stars if I could get it to work again  Edit I was able to get it working again 5 stars because works amazing and doesn't use tons of data like Google Maps
