As good as the first. Only problem is some lag when screen is full of enemies, even with graphics and effects on low. Tons of fun, though. Nice work, Forsaken                  Time for a revision.  We need an update. I'm getting crashes with every other mission.  Still fun, just a little on the imperfect side.
Hands down the best mobile game I've played. I LOVE this game. It has it's glitches, nothing's perfect. The devs are always hard at work on updates, and have built a great game. If your phone can handle it, do yourself a favor and get this game and a MOGA controller You won't be disappointed.
The game is starting to kick me right in the middle of a fight and the arena kicks me off the game after my hero dies
Really good You could fix it for net 10 phone it does not work
Great game If graphics for android could kill this would be it. The gameplay abd everything moves and runs smoothly on everything I have. Great idea and its not a pay to win.
I want to enjoy it... Too many random crashes on Note 4. Game is currently unplayable in its current state. Great devs and I know they'll be on top of it, but for now...hold off on buying.
I love it but can you modify this game for nexus 7, when there are many enemy, game begin to lag and I can't dodge arrows and I died, please fix it
5 stars after the update I love the blurin effect for the level detail, and the game doesn't lag much on adreno 430 anymore
Yas This is a great game for mobile time wasters
Very addictive. No pain, no gain
Needs optimization but great game also closes some times but overall 5 out a 5
