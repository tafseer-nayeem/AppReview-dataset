I am keeping this game forever I love this game so much I can't stop talking about it it is just so amazing Plus I love the guy Perry he's really cute and my mommy loves it too she likes the alligator this is Hannah speaking and I love this game so much goodbye
Love this game it's awsome but it had to buy full version to get more than 6 levels that made me very mad 
Fun You're solving levels all the time it is so much fun and I have so much fun I can't explain

Great game I love it and suggest that everyone should play it.
