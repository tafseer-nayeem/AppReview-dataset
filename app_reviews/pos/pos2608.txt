Great game When I first downloaded this game, all I got was a black screen so I uninstalled it and I redownloaded it today and it works GREAT.....I love this game.....you should download
It good But actually if it was a full 11 on 11 game it would be better
For All you haters This is a great game on xbox360 and works perfectly on mobile and if it doesn't work for you than you most have Android 5.0 or higher that means this game is too old for your phone or the game hasn't updated yet so just wait OK. And this game is great it works perfectly on my phone B
Amazing So good the tackling running love it i am addicted
Epic The game is a whole lot better than the first one
Awesome I had this game a few years ago and I thought it was fun so I am buying it right now but I will probably have to return it cause my mom will find out that I spent 3.00 but I don't care.
Fun I can't stop playing its an amazing game
