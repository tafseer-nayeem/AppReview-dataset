Addictive Astrology Great app with lots of good info and visuals. Notifications give some interesting data. Love it, works great Totally worth the price.
So awesome I love using this app when im outside in the evenings, i just lift up my tablet and look around the sky. Really fun to learn a bit more about space even though astronomy isn't one of my hobbies. Very detailed, and good interface.
Outstanding delivery This application delivers as advertised. I just wish that it will have some type of study tools added to the application. Study tools concerning astronomy.o
Amazing. Excellent quality, impressive load of information, augmented reality works like a charm. An absolute must have for anyone hooked up on astronomy. Thanks

Star Chart I have several of the best ones but this one is the very best . when hooked up to my big screen the detail is amazing . This is defently  the scope to have if you want to visit in real time . The wonders of the universe never ends . Hours  Hours  Hours of exploring . This is highly educational for all ages . You won't be disappointed . 9.99 is very reasonable for educational purposes to offer your kids who love to learn . Ken
