Awesome app. A must have Love the app. However it would be nice to be able to add my own streams.  Example Glenn Beck plays between 912 in the morning in Toledo in 1370 wspd. But in the app the earliest I can get is 123.  Also a button to report broken channels could be helpful.
Great App I always get to hear good talk radio now from all over the country from folks my local stations don't carry. Great App
Great No issues, works perfectly on the Note 3.
