Still love it, but let us make diss tracks Please make Popcorn for android I love that game on pc
Everybody HATERS GONE HATE...I HATE YOU HATERS I LOVE THIS GAME IT'S NOT EVEN COMPLICATED AND THIS IS COMING FROM AN 8TH GRADER
Popscene I personly loved it because you get to live the life of a music superstar and you get to use your own music as songs that your character publishes and the character sings the songs at concerts. BUY IT BECAUSE YOU WILL LOVE IT
I've played all the mobile games And I still think that popscene is the best. WRESTLING REVOLUTION is great but it has problems. Popscene needs a way to improve your attributes and other people's attribute
Good Very game, if you're intelligent enough you can get to the top with ease, looking for a game just like it
