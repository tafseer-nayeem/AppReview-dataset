Wtf I love the game but now it won't load, I just get the Dead Among Us screen. Wtf's up with that
Except the costly IAP the game is too good to play. And this game is really a good one as we can play it in portrait mode itself.
Love it Awesome game Love the storyish thing
Dead among us My friends told me to play the game.
Cool Just awesome
Not bad game needs better arrow controls
Nice This game is so intresting
This is a great zombie shooting game. Makes me think about Daryl from the Walking Dead with the whole bow and arrow.
Best game 1 no

Best game
It's cool It's actually pretty good to be honest. Add some more bows and improve graphics and detail a little bit and it would be awesome..like more object's and cars in the street would make it stand out during gameplay but either way good game.
Zombies and arrows A great game that has kept me going for hours on some long night
