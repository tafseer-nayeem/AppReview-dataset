Thank you I recently moved to Texas from California I really appreciated the 15 free minutes because I'm away from my son right now he is seven years old and is having a really hard time with me being away from the bottom of both of our hearts thank you we both needed to hear each others voices and u made it happen five stars no doubt
Great, but one problem... The credits run out too fast and sometimes when you complete an offer it won't give you the reward credits.
Breath of fresh air Really great App had one instance with dead air on a phone call but other than that great App
This is a fairly good app. The only problem is getting your credits when you do the surveys.
Saved me I don't make a lot of money and use a payasyougo phone. I am always having to worry if I have enough minutes for a call or run out before pay day. Now with Dingtone I have the freedom to call those I love more often and can talk for as long as I want.
