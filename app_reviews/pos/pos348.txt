Addicting Pretty fun game, been playing a faen deck that's still in progress. Only downside of this game is how slow it is to get gems
Finally.....HJ894825 Keeps me busy, great personality. Not too hard, but not too easy either. Love the auto and fast forward for battles. Enter HJ894825 as a referral. I don't know what we each get, but it a start. Thank you
Good Game But it freezes alot and crash sometime so please repair or improve cause I like this game i want to keep playing it
AWESOME I love collecting card games and played them for years and this one so far is not boring,found myself playing for hours great game.
So Damn Amazing The fact that we can't arrange the order of our deck makes the game interesting and challenging It definitely keeps the game more lively and the cards are so cool The game is absolutely amazing Coupons rock I had not expected it to be this great I even recommended this to my brother n even he's addicted to it now
Addictive fun Only problem is too hard to get 5 star creatures and even 4 stars sometimes. Please fix and get 5 star rating
