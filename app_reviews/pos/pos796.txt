Custom white balance My camera gets stuck after a long exposure shot is taken.  I can't seem to set a custom white balance with a grey card. The lock in the white balance does nothing.
Best CAMERA app for those who know a bit more about photography. Photo Quality is beyond comparison compared to stock software of my Note 3 Neo.
Together with Samsung Note Edge perfect combination As for shooting experience, getting closer to shooting with my Panasonic GH2. I mean now I can play with my phone like I am used to with my Panasonic. Nice and really working.
Still beautiful when it works Nexus 6P, still dealing with intermittent crashes and thereafter it won't capture images although it looks like it captures images but it doesn't. Clearing data worked before and now it isn't.
Love photography Nice camera app I like it Gracias Flavio, I got my money back already. Gracias por tomar importancia de las personas.
