ZenFone 4 Nothing to say......
Love it Its excellent .
Very nice and useful
Uploads all documents available It uploads all documents that is available in the PC. Such a waste of data. Anyhow, it's user friendly and has good navigation methods which most of the other PDF viewers lack.
Best app ever With this app you can view your PDFs effortlessly without no problem and I must just buy the full version of it to enjoy my office work forever.
Took this app for granted I didn't realize how often I used this app,  until I couldn't use it because i hadnt updated.  Hope this update works and I can get back to business as usual.
Good but need more improvement  Its good but not perfect. Protected pdf can not print out though drive can print out the same file. So, developer should solved it ASAP. Provide Zoom button and support mouse scrolling, it will help to read long pdf file with otg Bluetooth mouse. Thanks.. Best Wishes..
