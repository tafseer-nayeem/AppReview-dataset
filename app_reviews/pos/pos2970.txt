Fantastic Simple but really engaging for young ones. Build the town matching a combination of 7 tiles to make the different buildings... Many of the items feature in the other Dr Panda games. Daddy shouted yay at the discovery of the airport from the other game Brilliant exploration game for kids and Dads.
Shhh The kids are in bed and I've started my own town. We've unlocked figured out all but 7 combinations and by we've I mean my kids This game kept my 3yo's attention for over an hour today our first day playing  I highly recommend this game.
Game is cool I like this game because  you just make your own world. Angie gets combined things together to make your own things.
My sons love it. Keep up the great work. The game is imaginative and well made
Best game ever If you don't like this then you are crazy. Don't want to be mean but it is a great game.I love how you combine stuff and make better stuff.
Wish I could rate 1000 stars
