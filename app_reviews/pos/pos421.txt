Jake Love this app it's amazing how you can make your own video love this app
I can now do videos glad they put that feature for android users
Won't save Once I finished with the slideshow it I would go finish it but as it starts to load it goes white then back to the editing process again and it keeps repeating over and over again I need to save this video soon to upload it to my channel so please fix this issue
Worth waiting out the glitches I have always loved this app. I know currently there is a photo glitch where it turns certain pictures a wonky shade but I know they will fix this. Every other photovideo app I've tried is no where near this one. Please give it another chance, you won't be disappointed
Love it. I can greet people using this app. And eash to creat video. 
Love it I can make lots of vids yayyy
