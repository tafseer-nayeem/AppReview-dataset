It is Great My family plays a different way called Spanish pool.  A different way of playing  checkers.  This is the closest I seen to it.  Thanks guys
Classic Checkers This is the closest your going to get to ancient checkers,the only difference is your not touching the board or looking at your opponent which is a good thing,its very fun,play it,you'll be hooked
Great No suggestions to improve. I may even end up making ingame purchases, which I NEVER do. Elvista rocks
Good game only concern is I wish when you chat with people it could show what you said while you're still spelling,I think some people might have a problem spelling things right so,can you please fix this problem it'll mean a WHOLE LOT TO ALL OF US.
So funnnnnnn This game is not bad about adds and it can be  played with or without WiFi I recommend this game to everyone 
Great but The game was great but..... I am the best at checkers like ever and I keep  betting it, they should make a little harder but on the good side of things this is a great app to be used for people that like as much as I do.
Checkers It's the best game ever the part that I don't like is losing
I love it When I saw this app I said aaaaa OMG I have to get this And there is no adds
it's great I like the graphics. it does not look bad. the colors used in the game are ok.

Great I would have liked it more if it were chess but that's just me.
