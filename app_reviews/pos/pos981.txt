Wonderful app This is the app you wish for when you're tired of pulling out several different cookbooks and no room to put them while you cook Or are tired of having to manually input all of your favorite recipes. Love, love, love this app
Clever, simple, and effective. Note cards and recipe books are nice, but there are so many recipes already available that typing them in by hand is simply a waste of time. Paprika allows you to use a vast amount of resources to collect your favorite recipes. Better yet, it allows for nearly instant  not to mention flawless  scaling of recipes Well worth it  especially if you've been using it for years like me.
Awesome Loving it, great Zip list replacement and even better. Fantastic app
Paprika x3 I have this app on mac, iphone, and android tablet.  They all sync together, and I have my recipes with me when visiting friends, camping, and in my kitchen.  LOVE it.  A must have.
This IS in my opinion one of the best Great app for keeping your recepies.  I have over 800 vegan recepies and they are all categorized.  My only comment is to simplify syncing when you have multiple tablets and phones.     Also a Windows version for my laptop would be great.
This app has changed my life Only app I've found that easily captures recipes off the web, let's me plan meals and sorts my shopping list. Love it. And the Mac version too.  One feature that would be useful is to be able to see how long it is since you last used a recipe.
Love it Excellent app. I tell anyone interested about it's features and easy to use UI.
