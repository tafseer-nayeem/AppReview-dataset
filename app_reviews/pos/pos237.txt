Best backup Works great, backs up EVERYTHING. Easy to use and good options. Highly recommended
The automated daily backup is a very useful feature, and this backup words without root access, too.
A total backup solution Easy to use, much easier to create backups both online to the cloud and locally to your computer or sd card than it is using google or other back up solutions. The app literally Baca everything up too. And restoring your phone from a back up is a doddle. This is my favourite paid app and it is worth its weight in gold I think.
Mr I will not stay without it
Great program
Time saver
Top Does what it is supposed to do
Easiest backup Easiest backup even without root
Works like a charm
Simple and best One of the most simple and best backup application I have come across. Recommended for all..
great app does exactly what they say.... serves the purpose
Works as advertised I've had no issues running on my Moto X
Great App
AS It saved me in a pinch. Dropped my phone  some how the SD card was unreadable  phone was unresponsive. Got a new phone  downloaded all my data from my backup pro cloud. My new phone was exactly like the set up on my old phone. Saved me a lot of time, stress  headache.  Thanks
Backs up just about everything, and simple to use Very easy to use, and about as complete a backup as I've ever used. I've recommended it to friends and they're very happy with it, too. And now that there's a root version, all the bases seem to be covered. This is the first app new Android owners should get.
Excellent. Only app which enables backup to your choice of PC, cloud or device. I bought this specifically because of the recently added Drive, and PC support. Thank you to the developer
Excellent Most useful for backing up APKs of your favorite apps. I used it to back up apps like Google Maps when they make a good version, before they  stuff it up again.
