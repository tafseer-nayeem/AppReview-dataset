Additive Just the idea of going to Vegas soon is enough for me to play this non stop.. I mean at least I'll be rewarded as of right now I have earn enough coin for a free buffet and discounted rates at the top resorts.. side note resort fees still apply so be sure to inquire before booking.
Can't complain Its pretty fun. I mean you can't argue getting something for nothing. 5 stars why not.
I love this game Not only is it entertaining in my downtime, but the fact you gain rewards to use IRL makes it that much more fun. Can't wait to cash em in
Nov. 21, 2015 I just downloaded this game a.d althgh it's early to really discover any dislikes so far I rate 5 stars for what I see at this point. Only complaint thus far is I think the coin bonuses cld be bigger. But fun so far
My vagas This morning I had 9,000chips I went back. In and they were all gone and I didn't even play none so let's see if you really earn your 5 stars by giving back my 9,000 chips.
AWESOME GOODNESS Addictive fun Crashed on me twice but other than that its still fun and addictive
Awesome Awesome game...people need to stop complaining...first off this is by far the best game out on the androidapple system slot game that is. This game actually gives you a chance to redeem points for REAL rewards in vegas.
MyVegas Love it because it has real loyalty points you can use and we just so happen to be going to Vegas and we are able to reap the benefit of playing Love, love, love it The only downfall is that it really doesn't explain each thing like what the levelsvand what it does for you etc. Not explictly anyway.
