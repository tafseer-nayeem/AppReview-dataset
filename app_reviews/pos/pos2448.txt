Loviny it... But.. All planes are black while flight...it would be the awesomest game if planes are colored....  Plz fix it... Otherwise am just mad of this game now... lt3.   
I got ideas for update Add first person view to see the cockpit , a rudder between the throttle and landing gears , helicopters you can buy with gold coins in the game , more graphics to the crash
More interaction needed I love the game just waiting for the new games. I also notice random aircrafts either flying or preparing to take off which cause me to crash into them a few times. I feel this needs to be improve. I would also like to get some ATC action
Best simulator so far. My favorite flight simulator I recommend adding some form of ATC though, to request permission for take off and landings, in order to avoid plane collisions. Also, please add more maps, and capability to fly from one map to the other 
Best game ever I absolutely love it even though I'm a girl  this game is like no other, it's so realistic and has loads of missions and other cool stuff. Thank you xxx
Hhmmmm OK but only played for about 60 seconds andbalready asking for ratings, why do so many games ask u before you've had a chance to see what it's actually like
Good Game but not a Simulator. Definitely not a flight simulator by any means however it is a great aircraft game and the best looking one on the Play Store
The Graphics and Simulation is quite impressible Its not only an entertaining, engaging game but you can learn some about flying a plane rescuing people ,knowing some facts its quite educational and I am sure you guys will love it
Awseome sauce In no time ill become the best pilot known......... in the game that is
Amazing This is the best game ever.try it.some paid apps are useless but this is amazing.try it you will love.and also dont read the mean comments
