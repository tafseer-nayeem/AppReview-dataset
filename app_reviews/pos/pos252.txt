Mobile Comics in digital era Ga perlu bayar buar beli komik, selalu update dan totally menghibur Super like  tapi kenapa Komik Shiver di Handphoneku kadang suaranya ga muncul yah Padahal handphone ga di silent dan Sound nya ON. Need advice, thanks. 
Really Entertaining I love this app. I've read so many useful and enjoyable webcomic every week.
It only has manhwa It's good actually but late for update
Its grrrrrrrrrreat Great app. Simple, intuitive and free  Only thing 2 things missing are having the option to open at a specific tab i.e. subscribed at load and sorting by  updatedunread status.
SOUND OF YOUR HEART IS BEST
Keren Ga usah beli komik lagi
 
Love it Whata best way to spend your spare time.. various genre of comics but my favorite still the comedy and drama 
I love this app I never read to comik before bc I think it'll be boring and then I try to read it on Webtoon and it's interesting and I start to read it everyday. I really enjoyed read a digital comik like this than read it on paper book
Love webtoon It makes me the workaholic, could read webtoon even when I'm not home..
Mantaaaabbbs gan Lanjutkan D
