Nice but limited If you could add a mode where random bets would come up, to practise, it would be great to practise and not only learning
Brilliant Really clever app. Great help refreshing my memory after 10 years out of the industry. Well worth the money. Thanks guys
very helpful app i am a dealer from 10 years and still use it
Great App I found this app really useful, I am planning to get back into dealing after being out of the casino for over 6 years, this app really helped with memorizing picture bets, etc.  Highly recommend
Great app Very helpful
Great app for roulette dealers Works well. Love seeing chips on the layout. Really helping me get better at payouts. I'm much better already and I only downloaded a couple of days ago.
Great Learning Tool Awesome app  I can't wait to show it to my students in Puerto Rico.  They are going to love it.  Technically is very well made.  Been using it for two weeks and so far it has worked great.
Great app I recently changed careers and went into table games dealing, this app helped me alot in memorizing the picture bets and with the adding of several chip stacks in various positions, I also find myself using this app regularly even after I passed my audition for dealer to help keep my mental math skills sharp, now only if they could make a craps trainer app as that is my next game to learn
As a Roulette teacher I encourage my students to download this app.   I find  students that use this app learn faster.
Exactly what I was looking for I was struggling to find a good way to practice my 17 and 35 times tables online. This is what I was looking for and so much more. If you are a trainee do not hesitate to buy... you won't regret it
Love this app If you want to pass a roulette audition get this app. It really helped me learn my times tables and picture bets, which made me confident on my audition. I passed, so now I'm employed as a roulette dealer. Great app.
