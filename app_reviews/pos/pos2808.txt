No way out I like the new game, but there's no way to exit it with locking and then unlocking my phone and stabbing the app dock button.
The latest update is horrible I prefer the old interface, but I figured I can get used to it but the game constantly crashes.  Please fix it or refund my money.
The new update is awesome I live the new features of the new update, the only thing is the location of buying new destination tickets is a little odd. Besides that I'm sure that the crash bugs will work then self out.
LOVE THE NEW UPDATE  Not sure what the cause of all the other negative reviews are, but I have had nothing but a positive experience with the new update. I was so disappointed when I purchased this game and discovered that it didn't support asyncmultiplayer. With this update I am finally enjoying the game to its true potential. Thanks so much
I like this game. I love the game and play it a lot. But the updated version is no improvement.
Great game I have the boardgame and the app just betters the playing experience. Had problems with servers but it was fixed. Love the app
No more server problems. Thank you for your quick response.  I am happy to say TTR is once again my favourite app My partner and I play it everyday
Hate latest update Crashes and can't play online games anymore
