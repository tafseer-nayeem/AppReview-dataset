I have always enjoyed this kind of puzzle if you will I wish the item's were a wee bit larger.
Hidden Objects Mystery Guardians The game is very mysterous so that they can make the game more interesting
Very Awesome Game It's hard to find a good game. The graphics are very nice.
I loved this game I downloaded the other versions too and play them all the time....no complaints.... except for the unnecessary ads and popups..... Super annoying but not the games fault lol 
It is the best game ever Wish they had more places
Fun way to pass the time while waiting to see the doctor.
Very entertaining Helps you scan and find things quicker.
Great game This is an excellent hidden item game There is no waiting for lives to refill or lame stories to play out or anything. Just continuous and challenging searches.
I  love thes kind of games Come join me
Keeps an aging mind sharper, and to boot, its fun......
