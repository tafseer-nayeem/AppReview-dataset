Backup and restore I did a factory reset on my phone and now that I reinstall the app I used the back up and restore. Yes it did restore all the mark favorite mangas but did not restore the downloaded manga... also if possible please improve the recent thanks a bunch and more power y
Excellent Great app, for reading manga. Although, I am getting an intermittent loading issue where either a grey screen is loaded or it skips a chapter. No other issues, keep up the great work.
Works perfectly Had a few problems with my old phone but now it's perfect. Features are great, especially backup.
Im about to get a new phone and I was wondering when I add this app to the new phone, will it also have the full version that I have on this one
Cool  very easy to use Easy to navigate and updates are on time
Epic The experience is seriously good.. And as a manga lover this app is really helpful
Working notifications One of the few apps that send you updates on time or at most a few hours after its up on the website
This is probably the best manga reader app I've used from the Play Store. It works well with only minimal adverts  which for a free app is awesome
Best Manga reading App on Market Just as the title says. I've gone through a lot of apps for Manga. This one by far the best. No complaints
Works great The ads used to be annoying, but it's all good now.
The New update fixed a lot of bugs I hope more update to come worth every cent
Simply the best It has become a necessity...
