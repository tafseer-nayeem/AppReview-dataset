Very Addicting Don't get this game You will get addicted.. What the heck get it All of the fish look real The lakes looks real I prefer this game
REVIEW I don't know what all the negative comments are about, I've had no issues on the Hudl2 maybe these people are still using the Nokia 3210. ... Game is fun and a great time waster, also very relaxing. Highly recommend it especially as there are none of that IAP bull crap
This is one of the best fishing apps that i have ever played a really guarantee getting the full version it's worth it reminds you of a real fishing trip to lol
Perfect Hands down the BEST fishing game for Android. Simple, easy to use. It's actually relaxing like real fishing. Don't change a thing Please
Fun I love it, could use a few different, rod and reel combos. Or maybe some different lures, otherwise an awesome game for sure.... 2012 I sent this review,  how bout some new rod reel combos, and lures maybe add on options
