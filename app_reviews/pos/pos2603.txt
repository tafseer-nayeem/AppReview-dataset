Fun  Show how stupid I am D
Brilliant Quiz games are not really my cup of tea,but since this was on offer for ten pence I gave it a go,and I'm really glad I did.there are plenty of questions,even though they obviously get repeated.there are lots of categories,and its nice that stats get saved.top quality
Paid version not working. I just purchased the paid version and I can't find random games anymore. It says there is a new update but I already have the newest updated version.  I even go back to the store and the only option is to open the program. Don't buy the paid version. Edit...... I uninstalled and reinstalled the game and everything works now. This was a working solution for me. Changing review score to reflect game quality.
Enjoyable LOVE the game. Played Euchre my whole life, now it seems this is taking over.
Quiz clash premium I love it.

Fantastic There aren't that many quality quiz games on Android. You won't do wrong by purchasing this.Do it Enter your own questions. Rectify errors you find. Win when players leave mid game. They've set the standard, others should follow.
