So far so good My niece keeps getting on my tablet and messing it up hopefully thise will keep her off some of my apps.
Pics dissappeared after recent update After the last update, all my photo files in app lock have disappeared from the applock as well as phone gallery. Could the technical team please help me recover my data
Works great. One problem. Works perfectly. I like the option to turn on the mode where it tells you that the app crashed to disguise the lock. The one problem is that if you have battery saving mode on it sometimes allows you into locked apps without the password. Other than that, it works great
