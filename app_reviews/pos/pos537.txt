Works good I have 4 leagues and love the app for its functionality. Just wish espn would stop with all the bad advice on players...lol
Everything you need Our league has been on espn for over 5 years love the new app. Very easy to manage my team... espn themed chime alert has me like Pavlov's dog Couple of score glitches but still 5.
Suits my needs perfectly. I know people nit pick about apps and it shows the unsatisfiable character of most young people the ones who usually review apps but this one works great for me.
Awesome Great app, does have some glitches. Still a great app towards understanding some basic principles.
Works Does what it's supposed to, sometimes slow to update a change but i've never had an actual problem with it.
Great to keep tabs on my team when mobile Everything works and it's easy to use. Thank you ESPN for a great app. One thing, can you make it so when you go to add a player but have an ineligible player in IR, you can do it as part of the transaction instead of having to exit the transaction, move IR player then go back to do transaction I believe this happens on the desktop client too
