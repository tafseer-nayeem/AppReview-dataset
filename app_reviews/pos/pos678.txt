Addicting Love it and with some practice from all the other similar games it's easy going over 100 levels in. Did find a glitch where the science pop clashing with the color splash keeps making the game crash.
Addictive and fun while keeping up with the angry bird saga. It would be nice if it would remind you what each birds special power is. It would also be nice if there was a way you can earn  more coins or power ups. And to recharge energy quicker.  Just a few suggestions
Not bad, kinda like Candy Crush If Candy Crush and Angry Birds were mixed together, I'm sure this is what we would get. I've already cleared Area 1 so far and it's really fun
Loved The Game Great Game I LOVE THE GAME FUN AND ADVENTURE ALL WRAPPED UP TOGETHER YOU GOTTA LOVE IT.....GIVE IT A TRY.
Challenging It's sometimes harder doing levels on the phone compared to a tablet but overall a good game
Really good game Its like the Stella version but a little different Stella pop was a great game and im sure this will be to so far so good me and my family enjoy this game 
Angry Birds pop bubble shooter Fun fulfilled game love it
Cmon its angry birds So far no issues, fun, addicting, great time killer.
I like it I play it atleast two or three times a day,the colors and music is very stimulating.
The best There should be more colourful bubbles and more abilities Shakira bird should have better abilities silver should come please make a void super power bubble of green plus blue color mixed blue on top green on bottom light not sky blue the other turquoise blue green light green with type of flower in the between it will pop a full line cost is 12 birdcoins good that red and chuck are staying but all birds we have played with should be staying forever   but after all thanks
