Awesome game Love drawing never get fed up with this game. Been playing this a long time now and its still brilliant
Not bad Fun little game.  Aggravating when you pick a word and at the end the app changes to the next one below it, making the other person unable to guess correctly.  Also would like to be able to buy colors without having to wait til I am in the drawing screen.  Otherwise lots of fun.  Droid razr
I love this game Yes there's been problems challenge for example.That was so aggravating, but all in all it was fixed. This app helps me to use my mind and my drawing skills,something needed when you get oldder.
Fun Love this game Great stress reliever  you can be creative and also use your brain to solve clues
Family fun We play together and try and guess each other's art work. Good times

Love this game Game is super fun to play vs. Friends and the daily challenges are great too
amazing game Great game  Very entertaining and fun to play with family and friends..........I can't play the daily challenge, please fix it
Great way to kill time Very simple but you can make it a little more mind boggling
Fun Great game. If only I could see under my finger when I draw.
Still playing after a number of years... This game has got me drawing again after a very long art slump. The limited tools and colors really has me thinking about keeping things simple when I doodle. Neat little game.
