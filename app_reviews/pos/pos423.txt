Password LOCK Mobile HotSpot Pro worked GREAT, after I figured out that when I change the password I have to touch the LOCK button to set my new password. Then you need to turn WiFi off and on one time. All Good Thanks
.Mobile Hotspot Pro This application works very well. I rate it a five star.
Amazing app. I was looking at buying a mobile wifi device until I found this app.   Logs in first time every time on my Google Chromebook.  A must have buy app.
Works great with Samsung galaxy nexus Paid for the pro version after trying the free one and it is incredible. I have unlimited data and when I turn this on I get internet on my laptop with download speeds around 30mbps.
Beautiful It works perfectly fine for Cricket ZTE Grand Max  because that phone is not built with hotspot this app helped me get it keep up the good job just keep it update and let me know when new apps are available.
It work I love it.
Perfect Use on Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 to connect a Sony Tablet S. Works perfectly Read notes before you buy. Is best to try before you buy.
Excellent app for a couple dollars Seriously, I recommend this app to those who need to connect their devices to the WiFi wherever they're, privately, personalized and secure.
Excellent
Exactly how Yes that it
Exellent app
Samsung pushed an update that forces you to buy the carrier's hotspot service. Love the app. Would be great if you could find a way around that.
Excellent App does what it says Samsung galaxy S4
