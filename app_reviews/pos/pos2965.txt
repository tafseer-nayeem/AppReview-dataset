Hours of fun Quite a few diffrent minigames, and they are not variations of the same idea.
My grandaughter loves this She is now 6 and have had 2 years now still plays with this all the time, it's different and can tell from a different culture, just glad I found it, good work

Best game for my 3 year old, so far My three year old daughter absolute loves this game. She's very fond of the exploration and creative parts of the game. The game is of very high quality with excellent and Pippi like graphics and sounds.  A big hand to the producers of this game. Highly recommended.
Exciting, Creative, Awesome Even though I'm not a five year old or under like this game is rated, I still think it is just AWESOME.  That's it.  Now I have to hurry up and just play this
