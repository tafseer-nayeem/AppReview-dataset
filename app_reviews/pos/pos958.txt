Its alright Does not record the other person on the phone I have to have it on speaker and sometimes it doesn't record all my phone calls but other than that when it wants to work its fine just have to have it on speaker to get both voices.
Call Recorder Pro Very inconsistent.  Works at times,  then others not. Get real people,  fix your product. What do you recommend to use as a player for playback of recordings, better yet what is a compatible player to use
Top Rating Very handy for when people wanna try weasel out of what they've said, Ha ha it's all recorded...
Solid app I am happy with the app, it does what it has to do. Would have liked though the option to save the caller's name as part of the file name.
No problem here I don't know about you guys.. But it work perfectly in my phone lenovo
Clear and easy to use. Works great o n S4. May have to change recording format to hear both sides of conversation
Been using for over 2 yrs It's just changing the setting and the calls always come out great
Buti Wow This app saved me...
Super App New update with Android 6.0 It should be android 5.0 I think.
Helped me a lot. I've gotten fired under false pretense. I downloaded this app and called my former employer and had him confessed that he lied. Really saved me.
Defy Great app
Great on galaxy s6 Works awesome. Clearly hear both sides of the conversation.
