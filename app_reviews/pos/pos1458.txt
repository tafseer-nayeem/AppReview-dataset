Really great app I bought the pro version because it's a fun  useful app.   The graphics are adorable.  Not to mention,  it's from the same company that produced my very favorite app MemoCool.   What's not to love
Nice app  simple to use I have tried a lot of shopping list apps. This is easy, fun  reliable to use.

ListOn Love not having to keep written lists any more.  Would be nice to have ability for more categories.
