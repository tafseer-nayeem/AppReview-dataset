Love it I've loved this game. It's been a great time waster and a lot of fun for me. I suppose if you want to play the games you won't like it, but I just want to build the teams, so this is perfect. Highly recommend for anybody who wants a transactionbased baseball game. It's not perfect, but for a phone game it's amazing.
Satisfies I no longer have time to sit at a computer for the other version. This isn't quite that good but satisfies the addiction.
Amazing Game This game is amazing, not as good as the computer one but great for being a mobile game. The only issue is you can't control which players you won't to hit arbitration. Other than that this is one of the best games ever
One... More... Season. It's about time we had a real sports management sim on Android. Soccer doesn't count. Sorry. It's a perfect fit for the platform, and every bit as addictive as OOTP or BBM on the PC. Touch controls and player progression can use some tweaking but come on. It's OOTP. On Android.
StratOMatic for Android If you enjoyed playing the old card game and creating your own leagues and the like you are going to really enjoy this app. Well worth the money.
So thrilled I have been waiting forever for a great purestrategy baseball game on Android. This is everything I had hoped for.
Cash Needs a option were we can offer cash with trades
Great game but... Just found the manual save feature. Totally hooked on this sim.
Awesome Very indepth and complete for a mobile game, AND Developers listen. Thanks Guys
Best baseball sim on android A nice scaled down version of it's big brother.  A few bugs but nothing major.
