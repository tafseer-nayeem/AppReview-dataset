Not awesome,its awesomeness I can watch all my favorite TV shows on this app its awesomeness
I love it This is awesome but I wish you can watch offline and it has no ads that's so cool and awesome
I don't know Do I need to pay for this I am watching new episodes and I just had a thought if I need to pay. Because for spotify it said click for 7 day free trial. It wasn't free. Should I trust this app
The shows are clear so it's not  messed up on my screen but get it  it's great
