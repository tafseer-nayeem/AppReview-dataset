Great game, but.... So I linked the mobile game to my console version of the game, which I bought the Kombat Pack for, but I didn't receive the kombat pack on the mobile version of the game. Any suggestions for how I can get this resolved
cloud save wont work out of nowhere cloud save wont work, not too much of a problem but i dont want to loose my save randomly. please fix it was much after the last update so i dont know if its server related.
Connection issues When connecting from my home WiFi I can't play faction war or even Jason challenge . it always show me connection error
FATLITIES Why cant I FINISH HIM or HER after every match Please guyz add fatalities after every match of all characters I beg you. Its a great game with amazing graphics. add Takeda and Voorhees too  i am ready to invest up to 45gb if that's what game will be after adding fatality after each march. Best game in the store yet
Cant get enough of this game. Always new bonus characters you can win. Awesome character upgrades and the fatalities  are grafic and very specific. You will know what i mean when you play
Mortal Kombat My ipad has the newest update and it has early access to ronin ken but my samsung GS 4mini doesnt have the update it says the last update was 102815 please fix
