I love this game. I really like it I love how it chances you to upgrade your car so you can do race's but I do have a problem with it EVERY TIME I go to party mode it lodes for hours and it never lets me in pls fix this but besides that I looooooooooooooooooooove this game.
Its awsome The amount of racing,new updates,and amazing characters.Also Rovio,another thing that could be better is new carts for seedway,air, and stunt.And I'm talking about like the goat cart and santa's sleigh

Soooooooo cool Angry birds go is my one of my fav games please make more gameslike this
A true entertainment package This game has really taken Angry Birds' concept to a fascinating 3D racing game. There is also a 'multiplayer' mode as well as 'Local multiplayer' mode, which is amazing. This game has made a powerful statement about 'Angry Birds'. Amazing graphics, cool levels, and hours of enjoyment make the game more lively than 2D Angry Birds. Thanks Rovio for creating a beautiful game
