Great game I just wish that I could not finish it within a couple hours...I also do not like that you have to pay for additional levels..besides that..it's a nice game
5 s  Cause  I   THIS APP My brain is so pumped.  This app is not only fun  but keeps your brain sharp and thinking quickly.  I  intend to  download the other apps  by Jay Bacal.  Thanks Jay for the hours of brain exercises and  fun
Brill Winner all the way..super duo so good at coming up with superb word games I no longer look for other games from different developers...you really have to check all their games..Every single 1 is a winner
Great game This game is very addicting and is a lot of fun. My husband and I play this game together and see who can answer the next part of the chain first. I love this game and have it on my phone and my table. Totally worth the money spent.
Chain of Thought SO ADDICTIVE LOVE THIS GAME...even more then...LOL
Can't Get Enough By far the best game that I've downloaded  I regret, though, that there are only eight puzzle packs, since I'm going through them pretty quickly.
love it  Played this on my old iPhone and it's just as good that
S4 Great game now
