Awesome Downloaded all the full versions.   My 4 year old grandson is in speech therapy...now he says practically every word on the flash cards.  Amazing
Woth the purchase I think it's an excellent tool to teach kids the basics of their surroundings and the sounds are great...
Good app Could be some more cards in full version, but great app any way
Fantastic Perfect for 2 years old baby.
Wonderful children's app
