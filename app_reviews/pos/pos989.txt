Great app Wish I could set this to be my home screen. Would love a watch face that also shows my next appointment today.
Use it on second screen I put sports image logo on the first screen. Make it like a screen saver or something.
Excellent app for customising you Smartband Talk. Shame you can't replace the home screen with this but that is not the fault of this app.  I would like to see a grid in the design view so I can more easily line up elements on the page. Also the ability to add a few symbols so I could identify things like watch battery vs phone battery would be nice.
It just gets better and better Dev is very active and keeps making this more awesome.
Great, Loving it
Awesome I love the analog watch face. I wish there was a stop watch  timer feature.

Great Love the watch face choices. Also found that increasing the time between weather updates helps with battery drain.
Sony should have come with something like this
Love it Best app for Xperia Z2...All prblms solved
Does what it says it does. Prompt customer service. I had trouble with a function of my phone, thought it was a problem with the ap but it was user error. Prompt reply fixed my problem. Thanks
Works Great Maybe one day, Sony will allow users to change the default screen. This app is great. Ignore the negative reviews.
Well design Main clock screen did not make full use of the screen, this apps allow user to read battery life, date. Perfect
