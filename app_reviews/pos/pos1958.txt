Characters Well,i think it will be better if we can get the characters by buying it.I can't get characters that can not be brought.Althought i tryed it many times,i still cannot manage to get then...But it still is a good game ,hope sega can do more sonic games .XD
Love it but one problem on my behalf.. When you Sega crew show the new and featured characters. I go in my character profile and can' t find em I scroll all the way down and silvers there. But not the featured characters.. Please help.
Character Select Screen Sega. I love you guys. Please fix the bug where my game crashes every time I open the character select screen I would love to level up some characters and what not with my over abundance of rings. Otherwise, you've managed your game well, you just need to fix lag and what not and the crashes... also may we get Metal Sonic back in the premium roulette I missed my chance for my absolute favorite terminator. p
One of the best since classic sonic games  Like most sonic games...this is difficult. Also, I have NO PROBLEMS AT ALL with this game, its very cool ...is there a way to unlock characters  But this was very surprising for me D THIS IS BETTER THAN SONIC DASH  and most of the recent games Sega has made. Very good job Sega, very good clap clap   
Really fun I really love how you have to be good to get what you want in this game because its very rewarding if you played forever and finally can get amazing scores and great companions and characters, you actually feel rewarded, and the lag is not bad anymore on my Lgg2, thanks for that too, and ads aren't as common for me, you really did a great job on this game
I love the sonic franchise Like I love this game aswell there's a bit of lag and some lag spikes but this game is still playable all u Mario fans out there need to play real games like the sonic games and good luck in the future Sega u will always be my favourite game developers
