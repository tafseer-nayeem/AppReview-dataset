Great. Love the gameplay, love the match ups...just wish they would add different bats and uniforms, and also different stadiums to hit in. Other than that great game.
Took away my gold balls I had to reinstall due to a glitch, and upon reinstallation, my gold balls were reset to zero. Can this be fixed
