Dr. Panda Art Class
Endless entertainment for your little ones My daughters teacher recommended these games, they are reasonably priced, educational and great for entertaining the kids when they're bored
Wow Make sure your kids are wearing two pair of socks when playing this, cause one pair is getting knocked off The colorful graphics, the task and smooth function. Dude, totally rocks and the offspring love it
Nice My son keeps asking to play this new app. It's creative and even I enjoyed it. Keep improving your released apps please
I love all the Dr Panda games They are all excellent and well worth the money spent My daughter 4 spends hours playing these, and adores them.
I'm 14 but I love it Its so fun Its ment for 34 year olds but  I'm hooked Everyone should play it, its really fun at all agesD
