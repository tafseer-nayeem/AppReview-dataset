Simplicity at it's best Never a game so simple that can exercise every aspect of your temporal, occipital lobes at the same time divert your limbic system  to relax and not crave danger like addictions .
Awesomeness Simple and creative. If only we could have a ranking of the highest scores. I get bored beating my highest score all the time.
Its good I don't know why peoples doesn't like this game its light weight simple  interesting too.
Awesome I play this game day and  night and I didn't feel bored
Even though simple It can entertain you for hours great game
Simple  fun This is a simple implementation of a classic puzzle style game that I personally enjoy. While the app doesn't add any special animations or other bells or whistles, it also doesn't require any permissions or have any ads. It didn't use much battery life either, which is great when I'm trying to kill time.
Mario I love it. It keeps me busy and relax.
No permissions necessary Uses less than one megabyte of space Simple play. Nofrills.
