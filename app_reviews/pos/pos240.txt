Such a good movie and TV show siteapp I've had Netflix for 9 years and it never has at least one movie or TV show that has interested me if I were to rate it on a number scale it's a 9.9910
Improve I have an idea for you. Maybe making it so you can time you show when to turn off when your going to bed instead of missing out on some of your episodes. You guys proprably don't check these but just saying.
I love it but It deletes the best movies like dance in the vampire bund and they need to add more episodes to soul eater they need to do another fight and everybody sees Maka  powers and her power are greater than her partner and she defeats every person with her powers in every episode with her powers and we can see what her weapon is like a sight or something like her dad or kid or black star or her partner any of there weapons
Overall great app. Works very well, especially over Chromecast. Unfortunately thanks to Comcast data caps how much use it gets, and how much longer paying for Netflix under those restrictions will be worth it.
