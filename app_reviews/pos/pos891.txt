Amazing app When your LO is fussy and you've done everything wonder weeks helps you understand what's going on
Great App Hi guys, my son was born early 1815 my due date was the 24815 do I put the due date or birth date because the birth date seems more accurate in regards to the development signs.
Extremely helpful
So helpful I'm so glad this app was recommended to me It is so helpful and always spot on with my sons development. It's a must have Tracks your baby's growthmilestones from due date, not birthday, so it is always very accurate.
Always spot on It seems like every time my baby is acting a little more fussy I can go to this app and it explains exactly what's going on and how I can saistfy her. I love it
Great help Awesome at understanding what mental development your child is about to undergo Loved it
Love it Helps me understand  what she is gowing through and that im not doing anything wrong if that makes sense
Great but... Some widgets would be amazing. One for each child with a summary of days left in leapdays till next leap, childs name and what leap they are inentering patterns, smooth transitions ect
