Awesome but I wish you guys would make another like Ricky's backyard mx 2
Fantastic Job Game is sooo awesome Just wish we could pick the make of bike. Like KTM,.. Husqvarna
Great game Love the game. Only problem is that there are a few hackers. I've beat people by 7 seconds and tricks only to have them win.  There is one guy specifically I'm talking about.  Its happened 4 times now. Other than that its the best game for android imo
Amazing game Amazing fun to play but would be better if you could race using data instead of only wifi
Best game ever A great game to play love the tricks love the game keep it up
I like it But It's only 1vs1 or Player vs Player
