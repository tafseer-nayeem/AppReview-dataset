Game keeps freezing. I brought this game because I really loved it. Disappointed when the game keeps freezing during play. I see a lot of other people are complaining of the same thing Please fix because this game is so addictive
Absolutely Love It I've upgraded  played the entire game more than once  I have no problems with glitches, no freezes. Its awesome moneys worth.
Nothing wrong these games lol It doesn't shut down on me this a great game just hard to beat but i love a challenge y'all just probably have phones that suck
Hotel dash Hotel dash is totally worth the 1.99 because is a really good game you get the design suites for people to stay in on their honeymoon and stuff so it's really good game
Hotel dash deluxe Liked the game a lot very addictive I just wished it didn't keep freezing up and shutting off it would also be nice if it had more levels
