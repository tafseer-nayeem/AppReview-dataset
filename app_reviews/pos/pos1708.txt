THIS ALARM APP HAS A WAR FACE Thanks Gunny  This app has guts, and that's enough All the bad reviews...  Unless fragmentation has been an issue, its great here, and Gunny is owed one jelly donut.   Seriously, it works great.  Especially for 1.99
Awesome I was a huge fan of FMJ and i would sleep through my old alarm. This gets me up
Awesome Galaxy note II  loud and clear sweetheart.   Stop lollygagging around and grab this glorious piece of Marine Corps greatness.  I love it   thanks.
Cool A fun way to wake up
Works great. I use blue tooth speakers at high volume and it will wake the dead. Great job gunny
Gunny emerys wakeup call Great military app
Awesome app maggots If you like the gunney, you will love the app.
Sound the alarm Attention on deck Marines make do with what's on hand so shut your pie hole if it's not perfect. You will snap to attention upon hearing the Gunny, no matter how soundly you're sleeping. Now take charge and carry out the plan of the day P.S. Mooney's the man
Great
Right on target Now I can let the family have some quality wake up calls
Put on your socks and drop your cs Nothing like your worst nightmare to wake you up
The funny rocks he's a Marine. OhRah
