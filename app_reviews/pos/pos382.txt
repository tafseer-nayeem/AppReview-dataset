Great I dont have cable so this gives my little one a few new shows we don't normally get to watch.
Amazing My 1 year old daughter watches her mickey mouse on this app all the time.  Always adding new episodes My 1 year old switches to a new episode when one is finished all on her own.  The app is easy enough for her to do it.  We love this app           We use this on our Samsung Galaxy edge phone, and the note 4, phone, and it works perfectly

No direct TV They have direct TV now...yay                                           What's up with not having good direct tv There is a whole list of providers I've never even heard of but one of the big names for the south isn't there Seriously disappointed in this app..for now..let direct TV users in and I'll give more stars.
