Great It's great game with superb graphics has few glitches but it a bloody phone game being a 90s kid I had crappy phone games like snake so I appreciate things more lol
Brilliant game I payed 10p for this game and I would have happily payed more.it is a cracking game.great graphics,smooth gameplay.I have an experia z1 and it flawless on it.keep up the good work on this game.only thing I would say against the game is the in game ad on prices are way over the top for a mobile phone game.they need to come down in price by a long waythat said great game and we'll worth getting it
Great game I love playing this it us awesome sometimes difficult but still awesome.
Fun game It's alright, it's fun and if you're a huge Batman fan you might love this. But it'd be great if in free roaming mode you can oh gee idk,ACTUALLY GET OUT OF THE BAT
