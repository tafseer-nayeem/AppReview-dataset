Almost perfect The best billiards app on the market, hands down. The only thing I think would improve it even more is if it included a mini training program that helps you improve your aim, other than simply playing practice games. When I miss a shot, I'd like to be able to reattempt that shot so I can see where I went wrong and how much I need to change my aim in order to sink it. Other than this, I would say the game is perfect. Congrats to the developers.
Pool pro 2015 I love this game Have never found one I like playing much longer then a week but I been playing this one for over a month and still love it.

At last Love this game , after 2 min payed to support , I own most payed and free pool and snooker apps out there and this is one of the best especial cause they put L shape and such tables in game as I enjoy playing those styles of tables in RL ..
