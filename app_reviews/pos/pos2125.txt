Wow..... Just try JOY REWARDS App Using this referal d 1816147 and earned points.. you can use the points for any games specially The Clash of Clans...
awesome quite things r hated but still love this game..
Sunil007 Good game but it not a useful in life because once start a game we waste a lot of time because very interesting in this game I love it very much....but time are wasting always...otherwise love it...and 4line card rules compulsory is I don't like ....I give a full rating...... Enjoy.... Thank you....
The only flaw is not being able to decide the points value and to sit on which table. Otherwise superb, addictive. The newer version is better but the cards do not declare properly whilst declaring  the hand.
