Completed but then lost all data Got to do it all again. Lost all data after a reset due to a virus. Still a good game pity the other bird games don't have the option to vet rid of those annoying ads.
Better than angry birds 2 This is the way the game should be. Unlimited play without waiting for more lives or paying for them.
Space It's the best , your not gonna tell me anything drift rent
