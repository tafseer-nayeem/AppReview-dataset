Favorite Do not like new large text captions and count header. Can not place as many elements on screen.  Was this intentional Hope there will be a fix.  Excited about new elements, but haven't began the search.
MY FAVORITE 'GAME'  IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY 'CLASSIFY' THIS, AS SOMETIMES IT 'FEELS' LIKE A GAME, BC THE COMBINATIONS CAN BE HYSTERICAL,  AND THEN, THERE'S THE 'NITTYGRITTY' THINKING OF THIS.  IT TRULY IS FUN, AND ALL THE WHILE, EDUCATIONAL, AS WELL.  THANKS, SO MUCH, FOR CREATING THIS AWESOME GAMEDUCATION   HAVE FUN, EVERYONE,  AND BE SAFE.  IZZY   
Transfer elements from free version doesn't work I got the free version to see if I would like it...I do...and unlocked over 110 elements so I bought the full version and can't transfer over the elements....so frustrating....will delete if not fixed by next update
Please Update It Update this game  It seems like this game has been abandoned.  You could do so much more with this game
New combination Great game completed 390390. I would suggest war. Country plus weapon
Love alchemy Absolutely addicted to this game loved the free version so much I bought it and never looked back
BEST GAME TIME CONSUMING GAME EVER Amazing game love it. When I'm bored I'll play it.
Issue Not letting me import from free to paid version Still a great time killer
Addicting Great game Can you guys perhaps add some kind of log in system That way if users get a new phone, they don't have to start all over.
