5 star app. No problem with the junk clean pop up. New version is indeed BETTER. Feature loaded. No problem with JUNK CLEAN as its ULTIMATELY USER'S CHOICE whether to do it or not. It has EVERYTHING a FILE MANAGER requires.
Great This app showcases the power of Android. That Junk Cleaner needs to go too it just deletes files in certain directories, such as Downloads, which may be important.
A little jarred by the new notification but I clicked through and cleaned 3gigs off my device storage.  And because I've used ES File Explorer for so long with no issues, I was open to try it out.  As long as there aren't a glut of notifications going forward, I'm ok with it
Great My moto x doesn't has a file manager. So I tried many but nun supported OTG only es supported it..... It's really a good app to be preferred. It also works as junk cleaner so der isn't any need of installing cleaner.
