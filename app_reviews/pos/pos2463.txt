Very happy I used to play Heroes Charge, but after their terrible update I found out about this game and moved over here. Quite happy that I did, as it's easy to get into and feels like the rewards for vip are much better. My one complaint is that stamina doesn't charge faster so I can play longer don't mind buying diamonds every so often, but there's a limit on how many I'm willing to use on recharges
Great game but one problem  I love this game its so amazing and fun The problem is the big screens my tablet is samsung galaxy tab 4 10.5 and because of the size the game is very pixelated and has poor quality on small screens like my trend plus its great but i would love if you could improve the quality of this game or is there a way i could change the graphics Thanks                                                         I rated 5 because why not 
Great Fun, Free, and Matt Mercer. How could you go wrong

Fun game finally got the new update to work but I need my old info back don't want to start over completely I made great progress in game
Works now thank you
soul hunters I love you awesome awesome awesome awesome who's the greatest game ever this game is
Great Game Only thing I wish about this is reduce the amount of gems needed to recharge your energy please Its waaay too much 
The new update is ALMOST perfect it would be nice if stamina lowered to half for heroic and normal... or if the time needed for a new stamina point decreased by 3 minutes, instead of 6 minutes.
