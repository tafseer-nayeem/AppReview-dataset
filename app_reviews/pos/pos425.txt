Free Calls Love It Crisp VoIP Calls I Rely On This When I'm Home To Make Most Calls  No Connection DistortionDrops
Love it I have this installed on my prepaid phone and my nexus 7 tablet and works great. Now when I use my nexus 7 to call out it shows my cell phone  and thats cool. Now the people I call can't tell if I'm either using my phone or tablet. Thanks Google Well done. I've been using this app over a year now and its a blessing in disguise. Download this app. What do you have to lose
Why is this app not integrated into the hangouts app That is my only complaint. Other than that it's perfect.
Cheapest international Whenever I have to make calls outside of Norway I use this app. Especially to stay in contact with American and Canadian friends, for free. Have not encountered any problems in the year I used it.
Nice feature to call for free Occasionally run into quality issues unlike skype. Otherwise a great app. Unfortunately it is tightly integrated with Hangouts 
Awesome app This app is great for when you don't have any bars to make a call, just get to a hotspot and call. I live in an area eith horrible service so i just ise this to make calls with my wifi.
