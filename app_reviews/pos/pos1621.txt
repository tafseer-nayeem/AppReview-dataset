Excellent program, excellent support Paid for and was enjoying premium app. After an update the app  didn't work. I filed a report with the service link and received requests for information to try and duplicate the issue. Before I was able to respond they had created a new update to resolve the problem.  Great work
Very useful This is the best dollars I have ever spend on golf. I can easily find my swing flaws during range practice. The range mode is also very convenient combined with tripod adapter.I wish more short game swing can be provided. Of course, it won't replace my coach. I am using Samsung galaxy s4, very smooth.
Great app Was great but in the last few days I cant trim imported videos or record them using the capture method.....can u please resolve it Need to send videos to my coach
Great app but no Mr. Woods in it How come this app does not have Tiger and Bubba  in the model library Hoping to see it in the next update.
Superb Being able to see what I'm doing, and seeing its far different from what I'm really doing is invaluable.  Being able to compare to the Pro's to get me on the right track is great.
Excellent app Wow This app is great. Does everything needed. Very easy. I attached my razr maxx to a tripod and now i can see how many mistakes i make when i swing. Definitely worth 5.
Import video Sorry about the speed of video import, I just saw the playing speed functions.
Awesome Felt geeky using this on the range but the benifits were immediate.  Fixed some easy things and continue to work on more difficult problems. Works great with Android Thrive. Only thing better would be a live Pro.
V1 pro Has help me understand my swing to improve dramatically.
