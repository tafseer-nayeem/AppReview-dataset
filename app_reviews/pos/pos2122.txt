Disable ads. Guys just disable the ads in the options.  Simple as that

I miss the small games but I forgot what they're called. Otherwise, favorite phone game ever. Oops. See title.
Love this game They fix all problems quickly, and the game is fun.
D Awesome game love the graphics, the only thing that started bothering me is that I can't save my progress any more and when I try connecting to my fb it doesn't connect me any more. I don't want to start over 
Fun and Addicting I remember playing this game on the PC 2 Years Ago and this game was as fun as I remembered Ever since I started playing, It is nearly impossible to stop playing. It's that Addicting On the downside, I have this one glitch were after a while of playing, I randomly get sent back to the home screen. Other then that, this game is excellent If anyone is considering buying this, This game is definitely worth it
Why is it so Addicting I've reset a couple times now, just to watch my planet come alive This game is some good stuff
Amazing game. I absolutely adore this game. There are some problems with my phone not choosing an element if I've been playing for a while, but that's temporarily fixed by turning the screen off and back on.
Fun and addicting Great game to kill 5 minutes to a hour 
Nice It very good I am in love
