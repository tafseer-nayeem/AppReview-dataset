More levels Game was really fun. Loved it. Was very sad when i realised it was done. You simply cannot just supply us with 9 levels cmon.
On lg 650 The game was fun and light on the adds Warning newbies they play a nice trick of an add popping up a half second after the PLAY button comes up Some will think the game is 2 easy but either way thanks Amphibious

NINE LEVELS ONLY This is a great app but the lack of levels is not worth installing. I rated it five stars due to the entertainment and mind jogging aspect of it.
Good People give up to easy hence 1 star.
