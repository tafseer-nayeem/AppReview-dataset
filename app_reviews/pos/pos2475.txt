Awesome It's amazing, everything pixelmon should be. The graphics and mechanics are epic as well. Sadly, it does freeze and then crash sometimes, but I'm sure this will be fixed in the future. Nice job We Games
AWSOME.  EVER I. Always. Wanted to  play pixelmon or pokemon one this made my day happy and bright.  One. Thing I can't level up from level two
Demanding The game looks at plays great in tutorial and multiplayer, lots of fun but adventure mode is too demanding. It loads and plays fine on my Note 3 but has major lag in adventure mode. Hope this becomes more optimized for others to enjoy.
Love it but... I love it very much but it just keeps crashing and freezing when I press battle. All it let me do was do tutorial battle some pixelmon buy and upgrade pixelmon and GAME DEAD all in ONE MINUTE so PLEASE FIX
What a great start This game is fantastic the controls are a bit clunky . it's a great first game and can't wait to see what we games come up with next
Loved it This game thrilling and fun to play. I loved it so I give it  a five star This game thrilling and fun to play. I loved it so I give it  a five star.
