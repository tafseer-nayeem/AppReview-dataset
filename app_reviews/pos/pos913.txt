Exactly what I need. Although the use of more than two full programs begins to cost money, I love the large selection of free, easy to understand Pictures, Instructions, Targeted Muscle Areas, and Sanskrit Asanas. I was looking for flash cards basicly. I am a beginner striving to learn all poses, names and benefits so that I can become an instructor. I love this app
When I no the yoga steps When I no the yoga steps that time I was thinking what I do for my best yoga...nobody is here who train me.. but now I am happy to see this app..live yoga love yoga
Excellent App App contains all maximum pose of yoga. AZ information in app except few missing yog aasana
Nice an clean works good and smooth on Nexus 5. And it has a nice design. However, it lacks some functionality like statistics, custom programs or social sharing.
Its just wat i need Its a great app, its just you can only use it with WIFI 
Great app. This is my 1st app review because I love this app so much. There IS an option to turn the videos off in the settings which is awesome, but for 2 dollars it's added immense value to my life. I feel much looser already. I only hope they'll release additional classes in the future when Ive got the other ones down.
Amazing app for anyone who wants to learn, or try yoga. Love the design, very easy to use and get to poses. Thanks for the app
Good  But unable to access yoga programs Chose to access the learning programs but even after entering every correct correct information about my debit card It says the bank declined the transaction. The account got debited Rs.50 and still no access.
