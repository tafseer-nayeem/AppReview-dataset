Very convenient I really like the convenience and avoiding the risk of my card being swiped through a cloning device. I find very few stores in George using it though. I asked a few merchants why they don't have it and some replied that it is expensive. I don't know if this is true or maybe a misunderstanding but I would like every store to use it for convenience and safety.
Works Well, please add Seattle Coffee Co. Using MasterCard Cheque card, works well . Please addcontact my favourite Coffee place to join, Seattle Coffee Co. Maybe KFC and McDonald's too Thanks.
The Best Way to Pay The best way to pay in SA. The only thing that could possibly make it better is if you could use it to sign up for recurring payments
