I loved this game somewhen in 90'. I just hope it 'll be easy to control the tank.
Back 1989 nitendo games  i love 8 Supertank talaga
Super tank battle. The best for leisure time
One of my favorite game when i was a kid.Back in the days were video games are more fun and enjoyable playing along with your friends. But now i guess most kids has more gadgets than friends.
Super fun I've always play ds when i was young
Tank rules I think this game is the best i like getting coins power up and help i have made it to level 10  i this game i still think this game should have more power ups like going through blocks more lazers and extra lives
Nice Its bring me back to my beautiful days ...
