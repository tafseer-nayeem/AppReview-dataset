NEWER PHONE...WORKS GREAT NOW Updated my phone a few months ago to G5 and app worked SOOOO much better I decided to go Pro Wish it had Waypoint options though. Anyway good job
Great app      ,  .
Love It Great info for short and long trips. Use almost during every trip.
Works great  My dash lights went out and this app kept me legal in various speed zones in Dubuque, IA at night that are heavily monitored by law enforcement.
Nice app I recomende it this app fabulous
Wow This app is awesome The layout, options, customization, unique features, GUI, and overall intuitive feel sets Ulysse apart from the competition. It's hard to believe such an awesome app is free. Job well done, BinaryToys Team

Reinstalling... This is a great app for a casual cycle pedaler like me. It can even work with my favorite music apps, and I love my tunes while I ride. I'm doing a reinstall because I want to restart all trip records. Well worth the trouble. Major kudos to the developers
Accurate Great accurate speedometer. Works well if you don't have one that works in your car. Very much recommended.
Wow.. The date on the screenshot is my birthday And nice app
Speed demon I hope its accuracy is right
