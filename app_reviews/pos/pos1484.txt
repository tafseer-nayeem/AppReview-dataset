Just bought it I just bought it and fiddled around a bit, I have yet to use while I travel though. Seems pretty great though, I got it just to impress people in all honesty. 
HEADS UP GREAT APP. USE ALL THE TIME WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT EVERYONE THAT SEES IT WANTS TO KNOW WERE TO GET IT AND HOW MUCH FREE
Extremely cool. Makes me want a car with a daylight HUD.
Works great Just what I needed.
Love it Best gps aplicacin ever.
Totally helpful Was in the weeds down in downtown Springfield after coming back from a trip and didn't have my GPS. This little app came in handy because most people in Springfield don't like to stop and give you directions if they can help it.
Works great. Awesome app, and having no problem   with it. Other than having a small display, which I fixed by downloading it to my tablet and now use it for my H.U.D.
The best I like a lot now i don't have to see my cellphone to see where im going to turn it reflects on my windshield goooooooooood app
Exactly what I was looking for.
Amazingly simple  simply amazing I was skeptical about paying 4 bucks for this app. But after using it for the first time it was worth it. Super clean and highly accurate. Integrates well with google maps. Very visible. Better than the other apps. Cheaper than the 200 product on kickstarter. Only wish I can change the color theme in future releases with choices and voice control integration to change bookmarked locations
Perfect to keep your eyes on the road Works exactly as described.. Perfect integration with Google Maps
Sooo kool Works great for the note4
