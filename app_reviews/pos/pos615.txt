Best feature ever is you can play your own songs.....not even guitar hero does that man it's a basic game for music games but perfect I'd download this one before it becomes pricey 
Dope Was thinking i was going to need a higher difficulty level but then I put in Eminem's rap God and was amazed by how much harder you can actually make it so if anybody says that this game needs more to it put on rap God then come talk to me and if you're having problems trying to upload your songs onto the game all you have to do is click Select new songs and Luda partner sometimes it takes two seconds really easy
If you have the correct songs downloaded its fun There is no rhythm but the beat and drops get there and I played skrillex scary monsters and holy crap I was sweating at the end.
