I love it, only problem is with the voice messages, sometimes they don't work at all, but other than that, I love it Great people, i have made some great friends some even life long. Over all, fantastic

This version of the app is even better. This is even better than the original app. Just more older women.
Skout what Dose Any one ever repliey  This app dose not work unless there's a bunch of rude bitches on here no one ever replys back  So I give it an A for effort but it's an epic fail
