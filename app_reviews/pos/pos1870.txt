Best adventure time game I've played So, yeah, I played the game and I totally liked it. I went through the dungeons and finished the game. The dungeons were pretty easy except for the last one, I kept getting lost and all, but I finished it. The ice king really was annoying. Thanks for the game by the way. Jake didn't do anything, but it was still fun. 
Awesome Love..Love..Love..Love..Love..Love. Love 
Amazing Amazing amazing amazing love love love incredible

Better than Zelda Classic This is better than Zelda Classic simply because ZC is very long and the map system is very confusing. I just wish we have more dungeons in this game.
5 stars  I simply loved loved loved it  enjoyed every moment of it.. Thank you for such an amazing game 
It was great while it last it  It would've been better if it was longer, but for what it is it's pretty good and worth downloading, qnd it doesn't have those annoying ads and pop ups.
