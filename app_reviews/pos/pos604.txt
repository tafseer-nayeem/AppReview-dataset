Five Stars Works on all my android devices. This is very good way to kill time, and the kids love it. I wish you could add additional runways.
Dayumnn Soo good, the music is just the best too haha, this game passes the time for sure, always battling buddies for high score records
No longer on iOS This has been removed from the Apple App Store so nice to see it still here.
Works great.  Good to kill time.  Would be nice to have more runways.
The best game you can play while waiting to catch a plane, and it never gets old.
Great little clock buster. Fun in short intervals. High score 106
Love It My favorite game
Great fun Brilliant time waster.
I like this game Its a really fun game
Removed the dodgy permissions Brilliant now
I have no life I relinquish all control of my bodily functions to my little planes. I have no regrets in this addiction.
Charles Best game
Awesome Super
Great game
Great fun Namco brought this game out a long while ago, and it was always one of my fave games. Unfortunately, following a so called update, Namco spoiled it by adding shed loads of intrusive and unnecessary permissions. With this version, they have obviously been one of the few companies although slow to take note of the fact that it's customers weren't happy. They have now removed the dodgy permissions and returned the game to its former glory. Nice one Namco just don't do it again..
Help I love the game, but I only bough the game so I can play with other players. I can't seem to find out how I can play with my friends.
Amazing Very very good and is great fun.  Would like more maps but other than that. Amazing
Loved it Its a great game but you should add takeoff and emergency landing procedures
Back on track The devopers listened and removed the unnecessary permissions. Five stars for the already awesome game and listening to your customers.
Addictive Is an addictive game, but only need google play to store achievements
