Awesome Game. Really Fun Really good game you have to buy. It is worth the money.
Extremely tough strategic fun At first I thought you had to pay money to get anywhere in this game but actually just make sure you upgrade your bike with some of the first money they give you and then concentrate on winning bonus sprints and climbs at first. That generates enough to get improving
Great An improvement from last year, far more challenging. Good job
Great Like the one star guy said it's a grind. Much like in real life. First hours you will not be winning anything. Making very little money. Repeat and repeat. But it's fun. I'm enjoying it. And you don't need to pay money to enjoy it or get best stuff. Just need to play for a very long time. This will keep me occupied for several weeks.
The riders need to be cheaper
