Awesome Really fun I really love it its pretty cool game I recommend you getting it also there game car town streets are cool to and I recommend that one to
I like this game alot but what I'm tired about is the people complaining about the amount of coins you git and of them calling it a glitch when it's not. I will explain how that works. Each team takes a presenting of every win so when you see on a team in the store salary 10 that team will take 10 of each win so let's say you win 200 then the team takes there salary and you git what's left and that is how it works.
Great game I love it It's very entertaining and alot of fun. And the more you play the better you get. It's very addictive and alot of my friends play... Also, if you have a problem, they maintenance there game and take care of it for you
