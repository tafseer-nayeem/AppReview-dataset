Really love it ace My little brother loves to play but problem in the not full version as soon as you get onto level four it just takes you right of of the box your playing on. 
Love it The creature is so cute and it comes with its own cartoon but I HATE  THAT THEY HAVE A TIMER ON THE STARS HOW DO THEY EXPECT US TO GET THE STARS IF THEY'RE 8 SECONDS TO GET THEM
