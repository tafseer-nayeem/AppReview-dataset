Within a minute of downloading I was able to email an entire history of texts to myself and print them out. So simple Thank you 
Worked great It was easy to use, straight forward, and organized the texts well for printing.
Simple The easiest app to use for this purpose so far. No installing this or that, no configuring anything just email your saved SMS texts to yourself then print if you need to SIMPLE
Works great Its works great for short threads  2000 messages  but longer ones  12,000 cause it to freeze and naturally its the longer thread I need Great app.
Worked perfect. Really simple to use. I needed to export and print several texts. I installed this app. It took less than 10 minutes for me to receive them and print them
Great App Very good app. Download was simple. Select text. Send it to where you want to go. No problems at all.
