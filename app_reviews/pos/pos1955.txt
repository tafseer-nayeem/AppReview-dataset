Good MMORPG A mexican guy chased me with a gun and sensually stared at me until I fell out of the map. Your move atheists.
Awesome Great game thanks to the developer who made this and took a lots of time. You guys must understand it. It is not easy to create a game, If you know what I mean  Sir, please add weapons. Other than that, Great Game

It's kinda like infernal You had a lot of guns on the game but why didn't you put a rocket launcher on the game. Why didn't you put a lot of maps on there. You also did put taking cover. I almost forgot can you put language on the game talking and stuff.
