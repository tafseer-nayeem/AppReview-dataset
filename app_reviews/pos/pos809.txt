Everything you need If you need manual control of ISO, shutter speed and exposure, this is great. The interface is very user friendly. Powerful app.
Nexus 5x Love it The app is great. Really extends capability to use Nexus 5x pixel size in a great way. All functions work as they are designed. Would love it more if it had bulb mode or I can go at least to 5 sec to 10 sec shutter speed. My Manual camera app can't go below 15 sec. Bit sad on this part. Else everything is Superawesome
An amazing app that's dirt cheap This app is amazing and even without the 25 sale this app is dirt cheap and its a really good quality app. Keep up the amazing work
Exceptional There's no such better camera app. Any will do. It depends entirely up to your hardware. In this case, my hardware is the Nexus 6P and it's flawless. hint set your Developer Settings to sRGB.
It works as described if you want to have the capabilities of your camera this is the app. it can almost make you replace your point and shoot camera. The stock camera is faster
Great Developer Fixed reported bugs quickly. The app has a great UI and does what it says, allowing fine grain control over camera.
