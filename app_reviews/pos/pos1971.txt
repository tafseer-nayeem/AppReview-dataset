Wow. I never knew gameloft could make such a good game, and its SpiderMan Thank you gameloft for such an excellent game, it was definatly at a good price and it was worth the money Sorry if i spelled definatly wrong It was awesome and i loved it, thanks gameloft and i hope to see games like this in the future.
Amazing This game is truly amazing. I love it. Spiderman is one of my favorite superheroes now, because of it. Although I do have a samsung galaxy tablet. I do not know if it works well on phones.
Amazing And Fun The game is great but the voice acting is really corny. The game has no lag no glitches at all on the Galaxy S lll. Only thing to improve is the sharpness of the graphics.
