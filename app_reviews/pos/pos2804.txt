Just fun puzzling goodness Got it for the kids who are big fans of the show, ended up playing my self too. The 4 year old enjoyed it with little trouble, I enjoyed getting all the gnomes and the mental break. Voice acting with the real voice actors makes the connection to the show stronger, as does little additions like stage names swinter, etc  and the balloony bonus levels. Good fun that makes you think  phineas and ferb would approve

Brilliant Definitely on par with Where's my Water. Love the different challenges, just wish you didn't have to pay for the different game packs within.
