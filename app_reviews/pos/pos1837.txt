I like HOS games So, I was not disappointed with the game style. I really enjoyed it and it was a great way to spend a very hot Sunday afternoon.
Good game but it just needs more action.
It's a great game 
Toymaker I really loved playing this game as much as many of the other artifex mundi games My only complaint is that most of them cost 4.99 for full game I will probably have to stop playing your games as they're too expensive Thank you for the challenge tho It was great fun
Excellent new game with terrific storyline. Highly recommend.
Very Good Another winner Kept me engaged for a week. Good story and lots of puzzles.
Deadly toymaker Love it. Hard to stop playing it. Worth the money.  Will keep you entertained for hours.
