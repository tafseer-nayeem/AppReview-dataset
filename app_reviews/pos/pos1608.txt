Episode misplaced Hello sir. I just want you tell you that the episode of city of darkness from ep 21 was misplaced to the city of dead sorcerers... Im not that good at english.. Hope you understand. Thank you..  
It worked great the first 10 minutes when it works, it works the but after I closed out of it I could not get back on a second time. It says Loading and I left it alone for 8 hours, came back to it, and still its Loading. Reluctantly uninstalled.            Update installed again and works great, don't know what happened last time but its awesome now, although sometimes there are missing chapters so watch out
Awesome I love this app Only two things i would like to add, when its the last page, pull so ot can go to the next chapter, and to keep record of which chapters u read... but pther then that, i loved it
Great This app work good on my device and i love it. One thing that make me sad is, i need to back to chapter selection to read the next chapter, it would be better if we could read next chapter without going back to the chapter selection. Overall, this is great app.
Awesome app I love it and thats why im giving it 5 stars. Oh and Naruto's last name is misspelled
Love at First page I have been on a long search for manga providers after mine had been removed from the market, so when I first downloaded and checked it, I felt right at home So THANK YOU for this amazing app, no lag, annoying ads, clean easy design, and all my favs. PERFECTION
Best free manga app As the title says, it is the best free manga app. The only downside is it doesn't have bookmarks...yet
Love it I love this app it runs perfectly, but I really wish you could save what page you where on. So when you back out you don't lose your page. Other than that it is an amazing app
