What's the phrase I really enjoying this game Needs more cattergories, though. I have nearly 5 starred them all.
Fun I love this game I do wish that the puzzle writers would put in a dash  when a word has to continue on the next line because it's too long to fit on one line. That has thrown me off more than once, thinking that I was trying to figure out more than one word, instead of one long word.
