At first I had issues with the app but after sending an email I heard back from someone the SAME DAY on a weekend and the problem was resolved
Great so far I just bought my first comic and installed the app and I really like the layout and especially the presentation when reading. Before that I've only bought comics from HumbleBundle and it was hard to find apps that made reading enjoyable. This app works perfect however.
I look for the comic I want. I buy it, then read it. I love that they have full story arcs. And compared to actually buying these, it's quite a money saver
Alakh Niranjan Says Great collection.Especially I like the Individual panel view and gestures.Wish they add more free Comics.
DC comics are legendary This app is great with comics about great heroes
Addicted I never knew there was so much to read I love the library. And the pane view.
