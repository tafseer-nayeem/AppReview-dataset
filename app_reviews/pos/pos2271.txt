Best tarot game so realistic It is well balanced and at great pace. I can notice a personality of play for each participant that is computer generated. Great fun. Because of the level of quality not only do I have fun playing but my game is improving as well. Challenges you all the time. No matter how long you have played the game for. And me it has been several years now. And I still find it unputdownable.
Love to play tarot on my phone, keep up the good work.
Tres bon jeu
