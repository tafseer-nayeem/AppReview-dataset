Yay Got this for xbox now I can play it whenever where ever. I loved this game show since I was a kid. I thank my cousin who used to babysit me and we would always watch it together.   Btw you should make the game small on Google play then have it download whatever it needs once you load the game which seems what most games do.
Apps Even if this game does or dosen't work on my phone,its really no big deal to me. I only care about trying games I can enjoy and the quality of play.  Buying a game for one dollar means nothing to me. Only the game itself matters because its on my phone. Nothing more  Really hoping this game works though. Love The Price Is Right. Hope the developer reads this because I'm really looking forword to playing this game,very much  Also thank you for making this game
Wow. Just wow. I grew up with TPIR. This program is so very faithful in recreating set appearances, games, the costumes, the prizes A new microwave oven with memory function, in 1977 Top of the line. Definitely worth the launch price, and even if it goes up, the nostalgia factor is incredibly high. I'm already having loads of fun
Good Really good game so far I'm really loving it. No slow down lag or shutdown.
