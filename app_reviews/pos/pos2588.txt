Only game that keeps my attention. I love this game. You have to spend quite a bit of money to play but it's the only game I've actually continued to play for over a year now. Wish they would stop adding new stuff though it's making the game harder to play... Simple is good sometimes. It shouldn't be about the money but giving your gamers a good game to play.
Beta Account I hear about all these people with beta accounts and I wonder why haven't I been offered one. I've been playing for over 2 years now. My first kingdom was in Logos 76. Still haven't gotten one but people who started playing a month ago have.
GREAT GAME Best war game so far. Needs a few things fixed, like the mz accounts, the rallys are to small,and researches take forever. Other then that it's great
Addicted Once you get the hang of it....you can't put it down.  Find an alliance that fits for you.  RVE
