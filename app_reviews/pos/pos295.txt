I am ADDICTED to tetris, but sometimes it freezes. It also force closes sometimes, other than that great game. I love the new update too, I like the choices better
Turbo Game It's a little puzzling what everyone is saying. While I have encountered some of these bugs, they're far from entirely gameruining. I've found myself addicted and I'm loving the game entirely I understand the hype it generated back then. This version of Tetris is amazing and I'm sure a lot of Tetris fans would agree. I'm in love with the game
Busy mom down time game I love it. If you can look over all the adds, it's awesome. Loved tetris when I was growing up and now Love the portable feature of it. GOD BLESS YOU TETRIS TEAM.
Controls freeze regularly Problem fixed. Love it again. Still haven't quite reached my old record but having fun. Used to love this game. Now the controls freeze regularly and pieces fall unimpeded. Reinstalled and, of course, I lost my record and my place 1.5 million on level16. Same problem.  What's up
Nice game love this game for year from the first time I played it in a arcade when I was like 10 year old,its different but ssssssswwwseeeeet,but its kinda easier just saying
