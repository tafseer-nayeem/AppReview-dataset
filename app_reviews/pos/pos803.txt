Supercalifragilisticexpealidotious Beautiful and just what I need in my life Been waiting for the app to come out for Android and I am so glad they delivered Love A Beautiful Mess
Great app an great doodles I love ABM. The girls are inventive and so is this app.
Worth the wait I have been waiting for this app so patiently I love it and I hate paying for apps but this is so perfect I don't mind spending 0.99 thank you so much for finally bringing it to Android
Love. Love it So excited to have it available on androids. A tad addicted to this app
Value for money A lot of negative reviews from  people complaining about the extra charges for extra content.  My advice is,  if you're cheap, be satisfied with the content you paid a meagre 0.99 for The app is endlessly versatile.  I use it almost daily for my instagram posts be that the gorgeous filters,  layering text or just resizing a picture for IG specs. In conclusion  top app from top gals, Emma and Elsie.
