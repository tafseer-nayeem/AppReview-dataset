I have been dying to get this game I always wanted to have this on my phone. At first I could not because the amount of space they ask you for. Now that this limited the space, I am far too excited to have this on my phone
Good game but.. Wish it was easier to win tournaments and that the game would set you up with people in your league that aren't experts so you have a better chance of winning other than that it is very addictive
