Great game This is a great game all things considered, the option to customize the rules is wonderful.  The only 2 issues I have is the lack of online play and not being able to shoot  The option to create and customize the shoot the moon rule would be helpful too as there are many variations. Otherwise great game  Update 2 star reduction still no feedback on multiplayeronline option for android or the addition of a shoot the moon option.
Only okay at best The computer always plays the highest trumps first, which means you'll never capture points that way, but only junk.
Worthless paid for this app and first off it doesn't have multiplayer like my iPad. secondly it crashes contantly You would think a paid app would work. WRONG
Loose all the time Computer partner gets set almost every time they get the kitty. It's really sad
