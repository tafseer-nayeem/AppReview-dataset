Although the quick remote works on my LG G3 to control my LG 6300 TV, this app does not.  Is this app updated for LG 2015 models
App initialization pending, try again How do I fix this Installed in Galaxy S5.
Not working, on nexus 10 wdongle or wifi I REALLY was excited about the possibility of this app.  I use my phone as a remote for my TV all the time via wifi, so thought for sure it would work.  It won't connect to the TV at all.  No settings or instructions to be found.
Not working Payed and downloaded the app but it does not recognise the IR on the HTC one M8 none of the remote functions operate on 4 different LG tv's no IR activity picked up even when viewing through a digital camera.
The app does not work. Cannot detect my tv. Waste of money and time.  Where is the zero rating
Doesn't work on HTC One Lollipop So far this only worked for me using a friends Samsung S4. Have a HTC One M7 Google Play Edition and didn't work. Also failed on LG G2.
