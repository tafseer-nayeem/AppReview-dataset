To easy It's to easy but I hate dogs because he ate my pet bunny' .I should had not have two bunnies and one dog I hate this day
All you do is finish the story you don't. Even get to have your own house you just try to find a robber
Too easy It was, so easy and stupid even a 3 year old though it was easy
Worst app ever Everyone knows that this I a bad  app all you do is drive watch looooong cutsenc and some other stuff and the yays don't need nobody wants this lego this is one of your baaaad work and only 1 2 and 3 year Olds will want this I am over that age this app this app I THE WORST APP EVER SINCE THE FIRST YEAR THE FIRST YEAR NOBODY WANTS THIS IF I COULD GIVE IT 0 STARS I WILL  I WANT TO SAY THIS RITE IN YOUR ON FACES end of rage
Hated it This was the shortest game I ever played in my life. And anyways,what's the point in it You just have to catch a stupid robber.
It lite It said I can make my own place for us but I didn't it lied to me so that's one reason I don't like it 0.06 and I'll give you 5 stars or maybe I'll give you 2
The worst 20 minuets I spent in my life This stinks I hate this game its to easy and its anoing their some kids saying yay why won't the shut up
Wow that's it Wooow nice HATE IT wooow SO HATE IT
Ok Fun at first but boring and not so fun second time. Try it twice and find out
10 minutes  That's it......   Finished the game in like 10 15 minutes lool a big joke
Does not work properly Unlike the other lego apps which are good this one reset back to the beginning apparently and won't let my son do certain actions then mucks up the entire phone so you have to reset.  I'm now deleting it as there are no updates or bug fixes.
Not enough levels Short it is too easy u don't fail a level
why does it a data connection to work No reason it needs a data connection unless your trying to get kids to buy crap without their parents consent UNISTALLED
THIS IS RUBBISH THE GAME SUCKS IT KEEPS TURNING OFF SO PLEASE FIX THIS AND ITS TOO EASY EVEN A 2 YEAR OLD CAN PLAY THIS
How exactly are you suppose to use the stud coins It says unlock content with it, but the app has no instructions on how to accomplish that
stupidest game ever so short even my 2 year old brother finished it in 10 minutes deserves 0 stars
I LOVE IT  Well this is much better but what did you say was true because is  kind of boring
