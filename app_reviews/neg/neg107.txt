It doesn't work. Can't alter voice No matter how many times it give me the same error and not matter what options or lens, it says it recorded under normal audio... Can u please tell me what I'm doing wrong.
Voice won't work... Why
Uggh Everytime I do a video it fails to alter my voice cuz Whoops, something went wrong. If you can tell me how to fix this I'll be more than happy to fix my rating. Thanks.
