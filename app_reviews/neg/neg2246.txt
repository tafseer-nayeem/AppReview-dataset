Dealer 5 for 5 21 Random Better check your program.
Double Down Issues Wouldn't let me double when showing 9 total. Ouch, guys. Uninstalled.
Too much dancing baloney to play Single player againstthe dealer way to bush with animated cards and other crap to be interesting. Just let me bet what ii choose  easily  and deal the cards. Leave out the blither, play the hand then back to let me bet  deal.
