Way too short It was a fun game until I beat it with very little time invested.   I thought I was getting close to move to a new level and then it's over.   So sad.   It had potential but needs to be longer.
Some of the puzzles don't make sense Didn't use the egg with the number clue, still finished the game.       Loved some of the other games by fire maple
Angry, and dissapointed Game opens to black screen then closes. I have very limited internet and can not.download another game. Want a refund
I love lost world and grizzly manor. I do not appreciate the theme of this game. The other 2 by fire maple were light and friendly. Do not like the sorceress. Too many games have demons and witches. My small and large grandchildren as well as my daughters and I enjoyed playing the other two.  Nothing remotely scary in them. I will not only not recomend this game, but will tell others who like wholesome games, not to download.  Very disappointed. There's so much talent with these developers.
If I hadn't paid for it, I wouldn't have kept on playing. Having played THE ROOM 1  2 and many Escape Games, I was looking for something at least equally challenging or fun and this app proved to be beneath them. The riddles are few and very simplistic.
Not as good as thier lost city game Still reasonably fun but this was a bit short, some of the connections really didn't make as much sense to me  had to use hints much more than Lost City. Just not quite as interesting
