Does not support Online Multiplayer Game is Simple and Good but doesn't meet my expectations of online multiplayer, it never works
It is stupid But if you play with someone who you know
Nothing happens.  Can't get another player...will uninstall
Great game Very enjoyable, if not careful I could spend hours playing it...very relaxing.
