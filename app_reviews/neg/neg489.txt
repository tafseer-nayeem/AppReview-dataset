Worst deals The stupid deals of oyo made me sick in get hotal accommodation in app it show rooms are available but after reaching there after booking they say no rooms are available it happens with me. so don't become a victim for their deals. It is my fair suggestion to users
Harr ek customer zaroori hota hai Had a really unpleasant time in Goa long story because of OYO which has now prompted me to ask everyone in my hostelwith around 3000 students to not to use OYO ever. Now as a addon to the misery OYO won't rufund the money of cancelled booking even after their customer executive said that they would, its been around a month. Now approaching consumer court.
