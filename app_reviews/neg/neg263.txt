Poor Radar way over rated Weather bug radar free and better. Not a detailed forecast at all Example says snow.... would be nice to know how much Improve radar please Save your . Do not get this weather bug again is free and just as good. I'm very disappointed.
Samsung Galaxy S6  needs fixes Have requested help from support.  Some features do not work correctly.
I can't get it to work. No matter what I try, I can't get it to open up at my home location. Nothing shows up on the map. I want a refund
Waste of money This app is a huge joke. I can get the weather anywhere in the world EXCEPT where I live. I book marked my address, set it to center on my location when opened. Everything I was instructed to do. The closest I get to local is 200 miles away. Looking out my window is far better than this awful joke of an app. Chalk it up to a money scam and stay as far away from this as you can.
If you want a good PRO radar app.... ...keep looking. Sluggish response time, not user friendly, unreliable.
From 5 to 1 My reason for a lower rating is the multiple times I tried contacting customer service via email and never a response, since I paid for this version I won't uninstall but I won't buy anymore apps by them as they have my money now I guess they don't care, funny thing is one of my questions was about purchasing the other 2 apps...still no response, actively searching for similar apps, not that accurate anyway
No dev support.  App Going downhill... The app is constantly bringing up a mobile web site for Accuweather.  The developer does NOT respond.
Inaccurate details Free versions do a much better job. Sitting in accumulating snow while radar shows snow line at least 50 miles north of me. Don't waste your money.
