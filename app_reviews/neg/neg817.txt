Too slow to load each time uded, uses wifi Backgrounds are great but it'll take 5 minutes to load all options. If you select an option then decide it doesn't match photo, you have to restart process from 0 incl loading 5 mins on wifi again 
Really bad You people give usless apps theses days god make these thing useful
Stupid app I have already given update this but its dnt working Don't install this always its say to give update.its not working when internet connection being off....don't cost your MB.
Well.... I kept trying to get photos i had before but it didnt do ANYTHING The only reason im giving this app  is because its cool backrounds
V. Old Should really improve the features. Frames need to b updated  V slow loading
Note4 Very slow even with high speed net all images doesnt open fir 15  to 20 mints n needs more option lik sharing to other app plus add text features also th  it would b worth 2 by pro version
The app is good. It will not let me do some of my pictures, when I pick them to put in a frame only the frame show.
Beautiful  frames BUT Can't  get photos  to load  into the frame from my gallery but it does when I take the picture I'm really disappointed because I love all the frames please fix this so i can use it with my gallary and why do  you  have  so many  pop ups  that's  just  ridiculous 
Such a rubbish app ever I don't know  y people will give 5 star and four star rating for this sense less app , I think this is simply a waste of time , guys plz don't ever and never down load this muddy app
