Ads are too much Sorry I had to remove all angry birds from all my devices as they are nothing but malware now.
I love the repeated crashes and ads ads ads A little gameplay, long ads, oops,crashed, restart and bang more ads, start playing and repeat . Bad form, Rovio, bad form.
Booo I bought most of the angry games like two years ago, and played them on and off for quite some time. Then, they went free to play, but u could buy power ups, and I was hoping since I paid for the game some free stuff would of been nice. But, not getting anything didn't stop me from playing.  But, full screen ads that pop up while trying to take a shot will. The gaming world is going down the crapper if this is the new standard
