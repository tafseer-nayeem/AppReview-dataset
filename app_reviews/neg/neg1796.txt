Time doesn't refresh Used to work fine. Since a couple of days ago the time doesn't refresh anymore. Basically useless now.

Useless... As soon as u install the app it says weather app missing and wants u to download another app. Otherwise widget is not working. Its a trap. This app isn't even a widget. A trap to make u download another app....
Doesn't work.
Wtf Why do I have to use extra data to download another app for the weather to use the bloody clock,  unistalled,  time wasted.
