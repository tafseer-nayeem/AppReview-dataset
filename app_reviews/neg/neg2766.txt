Child yet to use. Will rate when my son uses it for a while.
Only five letter Abcde only
My little brother hates it and it always gets stuck on letter B dont by it its not worth it
Crashes constantly Can't run this for more than a minute before it dies on my Nexus 5. Looks like it might be cool ifwhen it's fixed.
Doesn't work Lollipop ready my new phone only came with lollipop install n it doesn't work so its NOT lollipop ready. Disappointed 
Unfortunately LetterSchool has stopped Won't even start up.  Seems that many users are having the same problem.  I need a refund.
Does not work with Galaxy S6 It gives white screen and then asks you to close or report. It should be tested for all versions
Not work In my lenovo a7000. Android 5.0 lollipop
Wonderful game if only it worked Fix it and I'll buy full version
I can't even open it I was really looking forward to using this with my daughter but can't even get it on.
Doesn't open I get an error and report every time I try to open it. My son's teacher suggested it to help with writing but they have the apple version.
Installed it twice on my s6. Wont work
WORST APP EVER, if ur gonna make an app how about u make one that actually works
Money You can only practice a few letters before it wants to charge you...dissapointed
Broken I purchased but it won't work. Turns to black. Please fix or refund.
Does not work with LG G4
ABCDE There is no more letters. If you wish to learn more then you have to buy the full version. Disappointed, uninstalled
