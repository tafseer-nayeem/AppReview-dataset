We finished playing the game with only 4 hints. Then, we were notified that we have got 14000 credits which we might have used if we had known earlier. Please add hints automatically to the game or send notifications to accept credits.
Buy hints or you can't play I would gladly pay for this game but never 20 for unlimited hints. Too bad...this was a fun game until the hints ran out and I got stuck.
Snoop, and keyboard fails Nice idea, might be fun, 1 star for this. Collects sensitive information, for example who my cell provider is. At the end of the first batch scissors, the keyboard failed to work properly, while it fully used 2 out of 4 CPU cores.
Okay This game is okay. Doesn't tell you when to capitalize a title, most of the answers of movie titles aren't capitalized in the answer, some numbers are as is, others are spelled out. Kind of confusing.
