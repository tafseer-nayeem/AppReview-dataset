Hate it. I cannot even read my messages.
7.4 has huge bugs No access to rooms, chats don't appear at all. Here's a novel idea, you should maybe test apps before publishing them
New update sucks I can't see any of my chats and I don't know whether it's the text colour which shouldn't be a problem,  because it never was or the recent update.
New update sucks This thing auto rotates and it auto updates my apps e.g Galaxy Wars in such a way that the app send me notifications but when I open to read what the notification was about, it's not there due to the ayto update
Hate it It's lame and it sucks Mostly hate the auto rotation feature, which makes the app crush sometimes
Auto rotate I am using Sony Xperia V, the auto rotate functionality has been disabled from my settings, but this is the 4th update with this happening, is this an version issue with my 4.3, build 9.2.A.1.210. Kernel 3.4.0
Too Slow Can you make it more smooth it lags alot and its definitely not my phone that causes this. It's the app
