Craptastic The controls suck. What a waste of time. Could have been fun but.....CRAP
Yay A patch. Bug fixes are coming more often Thank you devs. Last bug I see are moons and the comet are glitchy  in sandbox. They oscillate rapidly. And the orbits of planets are being cut off at the SOI. Great game. Keep it coming. Would love to see more moons and the ability to select in sandbox.
