A fair game buried too deep. This is a pretty okay game when you get a chance to play it. Unfortunately, between levels, you have to one by one go through ten or so screens trying to sell you something. I don't fault SEGA for monetizing. They're a business, after all. But when you spend more time closing out windows than playing the game itself, I think I'm not alone in saying it's not worth the storage space it takes up. Don't bother.... there are better games without the hassle.
Bruh, what happened This was such a fun game, now it is a buggy mess with a terrible way to unlock character's. Please for the love of god just let me buy characters like Amy, Sliver, Cream, and Big. You did it with these 4 so why not everyone. The menu lags, the game lags and sometimes the app itself will just crash on you. Until all these issues are fixed including removing the character egg from the roulette and making character's buy able, this game gets 2 out of 5 stars from me.
Isn't this supposed to be a kids game Why the HECK does Zazz tell Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles that's he's going to send them to hell That has no place in a Sonic game and kids don't need to be seeing that. Especially considering it's an E game. Who made the decision to have that phrase put in there Very disappointed, and no I'm not being overly sensitive. It's others not being sensitive enough in this case.
Lags too much to play With a 1.3ghz tegra 3 I can emulate sonic adventure 2 Dreamcast at 60fps no problem with only 2 cores, but this game struggles to hit 20fps even with the performance settings on and 4 cores. Sega, relearn how to optimize games, you apparently forgot completely. Also does not run at all on Bluestacks so I can't even play on a powerful device.
Used to be amazing. This game used to be awesome but it is now the slowest app on my phone. I get constant lag spikes and the loading takes so long my phone goes to sleep before the level starts. I used to be able to play this game smoothly on a 30 crap tablet, But now it is extremely slow on the tablet and my galaxy s4.
Playing on Droid RAZR M. In its current state the game is simply unplayable. Frequently stutters and freezes ingame, and many menus appear invisible and thus have to be navigated blindly.
Can't even play it Can't even get past the first loading screen. It always crashes at the same spot, I was really excited to play it too gt
It was great but The on screen buttons stay up, sometimes covering the x  button on the advertisements, making it impossible to continue...
Game crashes TT When I open the game it runs fine, but right after the first loading screen the game crashes and says that sonic runners has stopped, I'm not saying its a bad game its just impossible to play at the moment.
I hate it this game  I HATE THIS GAME BECAUSE EVERY TIME I COMPLETE A LEVEL AND IT LOADS IT ALWAYS AND I MEAN ALWAYS GOES TO MY HOME SCREEN I AM NOT EVEN TOUCHING ANYTHING AND IT STILL DO IT NO MATTER WHAT SO PLEASE  DO ME A FAVOR AND CHANGE THAT THANK THAT WILL MAKE LIKE EASYER. AND ANTHER THING I AM STILL TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING BUT WHEN YOU UNLOCK KNUCKLES AND U WANT TO SEE OR PLAY AS HIM IT WILL DO THE SAME THING   SO PLEASE DO SOME
Biggest Dissapointment Raise Your Hand if you like abysmal loading times, crappy ads EVERYWHERE, MASSIVE slowdown, unfair nerfing, and unreasonable recharge times. Seriously, I'd rather play Sonic Free Riders 2006 Rise of Lyric.
