Good purpose but no data Still not much use. Might be useful in future. Important cities like tiruppur, cbe and erode missing
Poor Plan ur travel doesnot work. It Do not even show the mode of transport between Andheri and Mumbai Central. Also the other transport shows the data same as mindicator and not the exact status of bus or train.
The future of public transport Great app and once the community feature is on, this app would be on every phone in the city
App crashes after update The app is hangs and then closed when i search bus no in delhi.
DOESN'T WORK I was recommend this app saying its more better than m indicator..But No this is not at all better doesnt work without net connection..Sorry but this cant beat MIndicator..
I hate this app I am dawnload this app for freecharge coupon but i am not receive coupon
This is not working When i m open this app this is not opened... This is not working ...vaste ho data
Wast of time, space and data There should be a 100 rating. That would be its best rating.
