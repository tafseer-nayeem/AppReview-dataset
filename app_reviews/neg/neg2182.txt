Ruined This used to be my favourite way to pass 10 minutes... Until the update. Preferred the previous coin system. What is the point in complicating a simple and likable system Change it back and I will happily rate 5 stars
Like the old version better And there is adverts after every game, not to mention the blasphemy that pops up oh my God what is wrong captions not to impressed with that at all
GLITCHY  FUSTRATING The game started out fine but it got glitchy  it froze. The game wouldn't stop nor go forward, I tried everything but nothing happened so my only option was to turn off my phone then turn it back on. I Sincerely hope you resolve the bugs in this game app. If not I will UNINSTALL
Too many interruption It's a fun game but I'm sick of ads keep popping up while your playing thinking about uninstallin this game.
Stupid game Game change its rule 2 stop u 2 proceeds  further after reaching on higher label.
Crush Egg Installed fine will not open
Don't waste ur time to many ads  pop ups in middle of the game To many ads popping up
Its  Not enough coins on the system game very complicated and too many advertisements popping up that needs to stop
Is it a game or advertisement Its not just a game with advertisement, but advertisement with game bonus inside. Too many advertisement and I dont enjoy play the game.
Once installed The annoying ads already began. I won't even try to play the game. I'll be uninstalling it asap.
Used to be ok It no longer gives you the two daily points.....  BS
