Hey, sorry for the one star rating. I absolutely love pocket and it has become very important to me. Since last few days I am not able to save articles on pocket. It says 'unfortunately pocket has stopped working'. However I am able to access the articles saved in it but not able to add new articles. Kindly look into it.
Note 4 lollipop 5.1.1 user I've seen lots of good posts and comments about this app. The ideea it's great, and I said  to myself why not installing it and give it a try. IT IS NOT EVEN 1 WORKING  I can't see or have acces to ANY of the pages I've saved. It's a piece of crapp And you're asking for some subscription money  You do have allot of nerve 
The app always crashes when I try to open it for reading saved content. Please fix it. Pocket is just awesome

Serious Privacy Concerns No apparent way to opt out of sharing what I have saved to read later. Not pleased with your recommended feature in 6.0  or  that you are tracking even if only aggregating what I save.
Not working This app was always a 5 stsr app just before the update. App is not working smoothly and starts crashing after 56 seconds as i open it everytime. Fix it please.
