laggs as hell on lg g2 This game laggs as hell on my lg g2 d802 with Blisspop v3.3 Android 5.1 like fps drops from 40 to 15 for a short time...couldn't play much with this laggs, so one star for now
had to install twice that's a lot of data use haven't played yet but will stay at two stars if more costly glitches I've got 20gigs data but not everybody can afford 1.05gig mistakes
Good if it would run reliably. Crashes often Great graphics, sound and fun game, controls are clumsy, and sadly crashes very often.  On later boss levels lucky to go 10min without Stranger has stopped. Tragic. Support says Try rebooting or upgrade to lollipop. Thanks for nothing support guys.
Nightmare controls Without a controller the game is a nightmare to control. Total waste of money. Graphics etc are excellent unfortunately I don't have a controller so it's unplayable. I maxed the graphics etc and it's very smooth on the s6 edge, no lag at all.
