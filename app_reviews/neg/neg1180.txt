Embarrassing I wonder how a supposed brother would embarrass Jehovah's Organisation by making what was meant FREE become a commercial thing                                                   .                                      I am more embarrassed by the brothers who encourage him to do so by paying him              .        I am deleting his app immediately however useful it seems to look
