Why no load even after download I tried to watch one of the newest videos, but the application wouldn't load the video. Then, I tried downloading the video, and it wouldn't play. Fix this in the update.
Doesn't even work Did you even test this
Stopped and won't reopen
Boooooooo Boooooooo
Can install the app, but not view any videos in it on the same internet connection
Very poor Most videos don't work and its hard to tell without checking through dozens of videos, which is which. Waste of time. This is why people torrent. Better user experience.
Internet It keeps saying that the app doesn't work because the internet connection is bad when I just fixed mine and I triple check that it does work and the Same happens.. Only the STUPID Lego friends work I'm downloading clean master to save storage
Absolute Rubbish It doesn't even let me watch anything
Can only install, not watch movies, doesnt find my internet
Who likes this Hated it worst all I have ever downloaded in my entire life
