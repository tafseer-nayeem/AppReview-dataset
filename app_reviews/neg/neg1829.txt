It's not worth the price Even at the half off price it is not worth it the bugs and glitches I can't even read it a times if it is in a complete sentences I would like my money back please
Sucks Every time I tried to tell him something like go back to the ship he still goes to the mountain where he dies. He won't listen or fight the crew. I think the people that made the game got lazy and just said what the heck let's end it.
Good idea poorly executed Decisions have no impact and the character was extremely annoying. Writing OH MY GOD before a decision 50 times does not build tension.
Broken The story is good. But whenever I choose something, if inapp or from the notification shade, the app crashes. It still registers my option, but then crashes. Please fix
