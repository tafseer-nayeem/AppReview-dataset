 Edit I gave it 4 stars before this most recent update. Now you can't delete your activity feed or your own posts, included previous profile pics. And no more daily reward.
Update issue I don't see any significant changing for latest update. In fact, I've still experienced ERROR and WENT WRONG. This update has erased delete option for moments we have, so we are unable to delete them. One more, where is the move to SDcard option for the memory  Galaxy A5, 5.0.2
Annoyed It glitches too much, I get error messages popping up after every game then it crashes,nI can't even see the rankings and I'm very disappointed considering how much I've paid for this game in the past. Not happy.
Doesn't work properly Can't see the right answer or the question number.... Recent update sucks
Creator Please Solve The Problem.. After I play for about 1020 times it always says error please try again later until I can't play the whole day. Is there a limit now on how many times you should play a day Recent update is not helping, though it gives daily reward, the problem is it always says ERROR please fix.this and I'm gonna give you 5 stars..thank you
Update has killed the game It lags terribly... Cant see your ALL TIME point total... Thought it was my new phone until I took it in to the tech center. Its your update that is the problem. I'm done
Update Well intentioned, but with new flaws Nice that Notifications have thumbnail, bad you can't delete them, old follow requests show up  can't be deleted. Old bugs 1 in multiple match, the score has disappeared 2 When a match ends, the opponent's level displayed drops to 1, regardless of the real level most of the time. C'mon Quizup, stop screwing up. 1 step forward,  2 steps  back.
