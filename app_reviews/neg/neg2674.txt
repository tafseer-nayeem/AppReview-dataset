Very annoyed I paid for this game and it does not work. When it loads there are no letters displayed, although all other parts of the game are present, you cannot see any letters, even though if you run your finger over the screen you can hear the letters selecting, you just can't see them. Very disappointed. Would like this fixed or a refund please.
Sucks No matter where I am in this game, when I try to return to it, it sends me back to level one. Loved this game before. Now terrible. Would give zero stars if possible. I emailed customer service 3 days ago and no reply. Don't buy. Not worth even being free. Want refund
Its a great game but I am fed up of having to reinstall it and losing all I have done..have reinstalled this game 3 times today already ..not reinstalling it anymore going to find another game..fed up now
