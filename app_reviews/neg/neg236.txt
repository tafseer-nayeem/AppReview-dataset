Crashes on Startup I'm running Android 5.1.1 on my OnePlus 2 and it immediately crashes when I try to open the app. I love the website and really wish I could use the app.
Great app but it needs to be updated This app is outdated and needs to be updated immediately.
Doesn't open The app doesn't work
Samsung S4 The application keeps on un installing once installed leaving a dead icon on my phone
