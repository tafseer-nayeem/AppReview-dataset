Dont bother 5 star game, till the glitches start the green car always locks up the controls. all the cars have the same problem it wont let you steer your car if you if you touch the gas peddle.  the steering control bar keeps going to center if you touch the gas. Then you wait for controls to start working game is half over then it works fine till the end of the race.
Stopped working on my hudl2 after upgrade to lollipop, it just freezes on the start up menu once you touch the screen and after two weeks I've not had a response from the developers
