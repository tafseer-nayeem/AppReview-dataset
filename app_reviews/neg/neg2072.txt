Good app but... Will tend to load puzzles at a different level than what you're playing, i.e, a Hard puzzle when you're playing Average, or Average when you're playing extreme.  Also will randomly delete pencil marks.  I've carefully noted the accuracy of my marks but find they will dissappear.  And no I don't have the eraser on
Sudoku Premium Love it, but seems as though game moody.  Will stop and even go back to home screen. Repeatedly click theresume game ,  it just goes faster and then quits.  Sad to happen to such an enjoyable app.
It keeps freezing on me...please help It works fine for a while but then freezes and the screen starts to flash.  I uninstallreinstall and works fine for a little while.  For some reason, it seems to be occurring more often.  Please, help
No good Too many bugs.  Some puzzles can not be solved.  Paid for nonad version.  Sorry I did because will be deleting game
Liked your product, but cannot wait. I hope you fix your game. Keep my money as a charity.
