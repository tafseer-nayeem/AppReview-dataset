No volume I can't hear anything video works but no sound really stinks because  I don't really need the video just need to hear my son cry at night
BISMILLAAHIR RAHMAANIR RAHEEM This is the first time I give an app 1 star, until the microphone on the parents device becomes loud and clearly hearable for the baby device on the Note 3 which millions of people own, all of Note 3 owners have the right to be warned before buying it, beside the bad quality video, at least add an option to choose the resolution and to cancel the zooming in comparing with other apps which doesn't zoom in the video.
Can't connect Very difficult time connecting, very disappointed
please fix this so you can stop a session then start a new one without having to go back in the baby room
Not very good at all I expected that it would be a good app some I had to pay for it. But it sucks. I can't constantly hear my baby, it only gives me clips of she starts to cry and there is a delay when it does finally play sound. And the video feed has never worked I do not recommend buying at all.
Echoing on parent device Monitor works great, if I'm being totally silent. It echoes and freaks out on the parent device. Please fix or I'll be asking for a refund.
Video doesn't work I have the most updated version but it always says it's unable to get the video
