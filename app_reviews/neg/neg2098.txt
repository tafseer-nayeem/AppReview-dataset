Crappy Was good now when you complete a puzzle instead of scoring the time it reverts back to last saved starting point.
No way to save games This app has no way to keep games, to keep track of your scores or place in a game. It resets to a new board every time it closes.  Also no complete word list or track which ones you've found.  Not a very good app.
