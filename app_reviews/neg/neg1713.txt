Sucks balls Bland app and doesn't have half the options as iOS. Bought upgraded version because friend has it.
Sucks for Android My twin brother has this app for the iPhone and is 100 times better for the iPhone and have had no issues with the microphone or being able to mix different features.. it is definitely a lot less enjoyable and I'm going to be asking for a refund
Not good for Android I paid the same price for the full version for me and my son and turns out that because he has an iPhone he has many more effects and voices Plus on my Android the voice sound is out of sync with the video.
Better on iPhone Family has it on iPhone, takes much better quality of video. Regardless of which resolution I choose, it is so pixelated, you can barely watch the video. And even clicking the fix sync button doesn't match the voices with the lop movement. I do like that there are more choices in voices and video optikns. Just wish the quality was better.
Cool concept, not for android users Great app, but android as always gets a lesser version. Not the quality I expected.
Upside down Selfie cam records upside down , why 
Can't get any funny voices
Mouth doesn't sync with replay
Keeps freezing when I record, even at lowest quality The app for iPhone is WAY better. Where the crap is gremlin face I NEEEEEED IT
