Great game, Terrible support, terrible cloud sync I had a character saved on the cloud and when I wanted to go back to it after uninstalling the game, it was gone. So I emailed them to ask them about fixing the issue and no response... 2 months ago
Way to buggy and slow So I make my character and I get the Enter your Name screen and the keyboard didn't load for over 6 hours Until bug us fixed, 410
READ THIS AND PLEASE FIX This game would of easily been 5 stars except for a tiny problm. NOW, I played this game and loved for about 67 months and when I turned it on today, it said my player was created on an older version, and I lost ALL MY HARDMODE ARMOUR AND WEAPONS. If you guys could fix this, I had 124 titanium ore, a True Nights Edge and a pickaxe Axe I also had 40 hearts. I am not lying this is true and the reason I am UPSET WITH THIS GAME RIGHT NOW.
If I could I'd rate it 0 I put that rate 1 star because it is sucky  YOU GUYS SERIOUSLY SUCK AT MAKING GAMES WITHOUT BUGS BECAUSE THIS GAME IS GLITCHING EVERYTIME SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENSLIKE I GET A MECHANICAL SKULL AND THEN.....CLOSETHEN IM SITTING HERE LIKE...Dang just Dang. I was thinking about changing it back to 5 STARS because I thought ya know Terraria has been good to me but now I TAKE THAT BACK FIX THE BUGS I BET ALL YOUR GAMES ARE BUGGY
Big problem Fun game, but the only reason why I started to play it was to play with my 7year old son multiplayer. I have an android device and he has an iPad. Ever since the last update about a week ago, we have not been able to connecthe can't join my games and vice versa. We have been waiting and waiting for an update for either ios or Android for a fix. Until it's fixed, it's hardly worth playing FIX THIS
