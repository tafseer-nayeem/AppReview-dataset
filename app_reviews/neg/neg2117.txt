Actually getting worse Hard to believe, but each update makes the UX slightly more unintuitive.
Option  capturing mandatory Options that would be nice to add  1. Capturing mandatory. 2. Flying king.  3. Man can capture backward. 4. 8x8 and 10x10 board sizes support. Just have an English strict and in case 1 not official rule does not make your game complete.  Five stars will be well deserved after you add the options above. I am willing to pay same amount for the added InternationalCustom options.
