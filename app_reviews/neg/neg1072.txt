No Royals Baseball Look I don't mind donating an helping out... But for me to look up a local podcast an it can't be found... is very disappointing. . I am on the road an i can't even get a podcast for the only 2 baseball games going on in the whole usa... hmmmm. The cuds ,  Mets,  Royals,  Bluejays.
Terrible It was okay at first but the sheer number of steps I need to go through to subscribe, update, delete, not download due to lack of interest of the guest, etc. The final straw was looking for a podcast with a certain guest and it presented me with 50 episodes of unrelated content and then it subscribed me to all of them and downloaded a bunch of episodes of each one, couldn't cancel the downloads. Don't settle for this friends We can do better
