Foscam 9816P problem Everything perfect, until I bought a Foscam 9816P. When turning off and then on Motion Detection, the motion detection feature does not work any more. It clears all the parameters of Motion Detection of the camera  I need to set them again via the browser method in order the feature to be activated  working again.
It keeps restarting randomly on my HTC desire 526g I have complained before and the problem still persists.  This time it crashes on HTC and Asus memo pad,  but works fine on my Samsung tab S. And these people keep telling me to restart the router... How stupid do you think I am.
Had high hopes Seeing all the good reviews for this app my hopes were pretty high considering majority of the apps are terrible. The one good use I have for this app is the record feature and everything else does not work for me. When I try rotating the camera using the apps dpad the camera moves all over the place. I tried the encryption password didn't work, got the 401error message. I'm using the foscam f18910w please fix or I will demand a refund.  T
