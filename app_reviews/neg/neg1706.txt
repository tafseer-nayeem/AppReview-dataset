Glitches, lag, and crashing 247 Seriously 2 for this It crashes right before I can get the answer. This is on a Moto G 2014 on Android Lollipop
Messed up questions and answers. Is your character a woman Yes. Is your character a man Uh... No That's an example of some of the conflicting questions. Are they older than 50... AND younger than 40 No. Why does it ask this Are they alive... AND dead If I say YES to one question, why does it ask me the opposite one It then comes up with dumb guesses like The one who created this site or A guy who gambles on everything. It's nonsensical.
Aki rewards are broken for me. I played a character that had only been guessed 79 times and your telling me I only get a standard aki reward cause reportedly someone played him within that small time period and any character in the two last ranks of akinator rewards, he won't guess correctly the first time
It keeps bombing out It's so much fun but it keeps bombing out, I'm tired of having to restart characters
What Got Black Aki Award, doesn't give me 5000Gz
