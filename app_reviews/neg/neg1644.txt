No RWC How is it possible that there's no RWC  specific category on this Android version Unbelievable I must be missing something...
Don't like it This app is brilliant for soccer fans. Does only international rugby and cricket. Useless if you want local rugby and cricket. Looking for an other app
Nonsense Downloaded it two times, but when I tried tapping it open, it refuses. It shows the blank page then to its OPENUNINSTALL page Disappointed
Rubbish This app crashes and freezers every time I use it. I have reinstalled numerous times, without continued success. Not worth the space on the hard drive
Fail to work Cant work on my smart phone y220
Some leagues are not represented No likey so much.
