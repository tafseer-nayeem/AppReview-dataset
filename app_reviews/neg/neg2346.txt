Well Don't know what was fixed because it still says no files to download from Google Drive
Waste of money So had the app running for several months backing up to the cloud, well the time came that I needed to restore. So I opened the app went to restore selected the folder and nothing not one single backup so months worth of messages are gone.
Program sucks Spent several hours restoring texts and when done all of the texts were not even there Run from this program Stay away
Why am I installing each app one by one after a backup If someone has hundreds of apps that can take days. You folks need to wake up and test your software.
Horrible Do not download this. Please use something else. Don't trust this app.
No backup available Purchased premium ver. Trying to backup contacts end up with 'No backup available' ,
Error in Xiaomi 4i  can't change backup folder.   can't connect to google drive
Doesn't do what it's meant to do The option to upload your backups to google drive doesn't work,  and on the rare chance that it does you can't get them back again What a complete waste of money
Doesnt restore SMS Have tried to restore 11K SMS msgs.  Gets to just under 3k, gives msg that restore was successful and then app stops working.  Especially problematic is the fact that it restores msgs in order from oldest to newest....so no my newest msg is from February.   And i paid for this
