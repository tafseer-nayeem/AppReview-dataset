Game would be awsome I have to hit the button 15 times to get into a fight all your menu buttons are the same. I buy a robot and pay for the game for all the fighting controls to barley work. If you guys fix these problems I'd give you a 5 star rating but as of right now this is a very bad game.
Wouldn't give me my refund
I WANT A REFUND Reliance games please fix the refund box I tap on it and it says purchase successful but my money is still gone.please fix this problem also it doesn't work
Old style I don't like why old games are dark and boring. I am getting rid of this game.I can't keep up with the robots coming out.      and why are the robots about 3 That's a lot of money and people have to spend a lot of money to play the game. That's just wrong.
Buying I bought the every robot pack and it doesn't give me the new ones you add. Really. I spend 20 on this game and I don't even get the new robots. You need to fix that
