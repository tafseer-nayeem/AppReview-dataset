Glitches Twice lve tried. 1st time dude on couch didnt show up for me to get clock key. Restarted the game. He showed up  killed me. When l came back... he didnt show again... un installing. It could have been a 45 otherwise 
Its Ok,Some Items Go Together That Don't Quite Make Sense,Others Do.I Can't Fully Rate This Game.I Got To The Part Of The Ladder But Cannot Place It.I Emailed The Dev,But Have Yet To Hear Anything Back.
To short of a game. If it wasn't for YouTube I wouldn't been able to figure some of it out.
Can't place the ladder to continue the game. So I'm currently stuck
I installed it twice and it wouldn't work. Something about license not valid
Error Error in my Xperia Z
Noooooo refund
So I get to the first level and touch every single inch of the screen and guess what. Nothing happens but apparently by all the videos everything I touched was supposed to either open or do something. What the hell. Did I pay for a game that just shows a back ground and a stupid little dust cloud when I hit something
Cheap scares and Short game Although the graphics are decent, the game features some cheap scares and very short gameplay.  My other main issue is there is not hint system.  The times I got stuck mostly because the game is so dark and its hard to see small items I had to look online for a walkthrough which inevitably showed me spoilers, ruining the experience.  I would have just uninstalled and walked away without a review had the game not cost me money.
Don't buy You serious A full screen ad even though I paid for the game That's disgusting
License error I already purchased it. It was stated that its license error fix this
No go Not scary,wasted my time and money.delete.
I don't really like puzzle games. Thought it be more of a adventure type of horror game.
Game is crap Thank god it was only .99cents
