Needs more Everyone has been saying this game needs more and I agree it's way to short for a payed game add more levels or something and it will get 5 stars but until that hapens it will stay at 2 stars
Too short Way too short. Needs more to do. Still no updates in months. Not worth the money.
to easy to simple to easy. there are no hard levels in this game. i finished it in like 45 hours. lol to easy
Too short Great game but I beat the whole thing in less than 2 hours.....its way 2 short
