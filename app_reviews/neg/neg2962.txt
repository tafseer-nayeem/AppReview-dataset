I have downloaded 2 of your fireman sam games and both do not. Why is this happening not happy after paying for the second 1
Doesnt work
Worked, then didn't This game worked fine for a few months, but reciently it has been coming up with a message saying that this game is not the licensed version. I updated the game, it still didn't work. I uninstalled the game and then reinstalled it, it still doesn't work. My son is upset and really enjoyed the game... when it worked. 2.99 down the drain.
Kid really enjoyed it but it just stopped working this week.  I uninstalled and reinstalled it and...nothing.  Pretty bad.
Not for kids of  2. Every game seems very poorly designed for kids.
Fireman sam Very poor already paid for it and it keeps chucking me off of the game
