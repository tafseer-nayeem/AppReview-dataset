Not ANY printer I have Ricoh SP 201N which is on the network via LAN so it sees the printer but the app doesnt support it, when it asks to manually install the printer my model is not on the list. Otherwise im sure its a great app, looks clean but please update your driver list.
Test page ink usages The darn test page ate half and ink cartridge
Canon lbp 2900 driver is not included... if it is included I want to buy full version
