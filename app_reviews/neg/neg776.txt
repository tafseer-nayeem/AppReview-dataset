Bad Update Whatever you did on your latest update isn't working. I used to be able to download a pdf file from my email and view it with adobe and now everytime I do it says file empty.  I will change my rating when you fix the problem.
Security After updating the app Dr Web send a massage that a threat is detected
Keep getting 'ERROR'. Keep getting ERROR. The document is empty. Won't open any PDFDocuments. This has been going on for awhile now. Needs a fix asap
Why Apps are supposed to make things easier. Why is it when updates are made so much is changed sometimes it almost like having to learn how to use it all over again. I had signatures saved in both my PC and phone to use to add when needed. Now with the new updates on both the PC and phone I have to take the time to create new ones. On my PC it won't recognize a PDF file to use as a signature. Really An Adobe app won't recognize a PDF file How is that an improvement
Error I am having an error it says to me that, the document has features that are not supported in this version of adobe acrobat reader. So what should i do now
When i add my signature to a document and send it via Google mail the recipient gets an unsigned document why is that When opening  on Pc adobe sayserror exist on this page please contact the person who created the PDF please advise
