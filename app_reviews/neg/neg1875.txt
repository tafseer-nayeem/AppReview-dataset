Very dissapointed It's Crap
Boring. No choice of where you hunt. Hippos go down one shot and a zebra still running after 5 shots in the  torso. Scope moves way slow and no way to adjust the sensitivity. No other weapons or upgrades. Worst part is the fire button usually takes 24 tries before it fires no matter how careful you are. Makes running shots and animal attack shots frustrating and very hard. Waste of data.
Stupid app don't get it... Stupid app don't get it it takes forever to load and it messes up you're device
Before you make a hunting game... i suggest that you go on a hunting trip. Crap.
