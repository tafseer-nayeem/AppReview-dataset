Horrible Just installed it after paying 2 since I wanted a ad free app.. Compared to Mobility ware game app,  this is an awful experience minus the ads. There is no solution to the game and Hints keep moving cards back and forth No option of a draw Wish I can get a refund.
Broken This game is seriously broken.  Wrong number of passes through the deck sometimes 2,3, and 4, card deals so bizarre they are statistically impossible.   3 weeks of play with only 3 or less plays possible per game with 20 to 30 games in a row without a single play possible again, not normal.  Worst is that no one has replied to my emails over  5 weeks of attempts.  Don't waste your money.
Freezes and has ads Even with paying for the game, it still has ads, just not as many as the free version. It freezes less then the free version, but it is still frustrating.
Still 1 Sound is very bad low. You don't learn ass. Next time i will report by my lawyer what kind of bad apps with malware you are released.
