No boosters I have done over a thousand levels on this game, paid real money for gold bars and you still haven't fixed the no booster issues I contacted you about. It's ridiculous you have extra levels to earn bonus boosters when they are all locked. Absolutely rubbish
NEVER any new levels Well, I love this game, but I've spent at least 15 unlocking next levels, and now I sit at level 297 waiting. No more levels Hmm. Guess I'll go play a Zynga game Update as of 112315 Ha, no update Candy Crush updates at least once every two weeks, if not more. All this game does is sit on my phone and eat up space, because it only takes a day to get through the 15 new levels WHEN there us an update. Which is never Totally not worth the money spent.
Rip off The game is very enjoyable,  I was having a blast however I was on level 867 and then for some reason I was reset back to the beginning. I lost everything lives and levels and when I wrote to the makers I received no response. I would like my levels back at least. Even a response would be nice
I switched devices and while it put me back at my playing level it locked out my paid and free boosters. Please help I want my booster back Help
Pet rescue is a wonderful game .When I play this game I forgot all my worries and sorrows.
