Doesn't work, money  time lost Worked for initial sync in the refund period, encountered issues afterwards. No response from dev apart from a ridiculous autoresponder that boils down to we're busy  OK, just stop taking money in the meantime for an app that doesn't work.
Seriously When I paid for the app  installed it a long time ago, it claimed it worked with Yahoo  it did. It no longer does. HOWEVER, now, theres another paid app from the same maker for Yahoo syncing capabilities. Seriously What did I pay for the 1st time
Tried with Synology Caldav and Google Calendar on Android. Phone connects to server, but calendars are not showing. Also needed another app to import my calendar events. Decided to uninstall and go with Baikal and DAVdroid and those are working now. If I could get a refund, that would be great.   Edit  Contacted support via mail. But just to ask for a refund. DAVdroid handles calendar and contacts, so for me it's more convenient.
Does what it says but had expected it to sync to a google account calendar
Does not work with Cal.dav Does not work with Apple iCal. I want my money back, only reason I bought it.
alarm sync  in calender does not work when I accept an invite from my phone,  it does not ring the alarm before the meeting.  Asked helped to the developer . Got auto reply  that it may take months for the response .  Not good.
