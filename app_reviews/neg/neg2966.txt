Game force closes Will update to five stars once the game stops force closing. I have sent in multiple support tickets and it does not get fixed. Have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times.
I don't exactly hate it...... I don't hate because I have never played it. I know I would love it though if I could. Every time I try to get on the game it exits my screen and says sorry toca town has stopped. Please fix this and I will rate 5's
Needs more The updated was just useless, but im on a samsung and I want toca lifecity  more than this. It would be awsome if you put toca lifecity out on all devices, kr updating toca lifetown with more houses and more characters and more shops and a mall, but otherwise, this update was useless. ..
I dont know what to say You have been better than that idiots that was the worst update ever changing the name so what. Whats next having the name changed again to the worst game ever now that would be a big help thanks a lot for the new update...
Fix Bugs It keeps reseting what I Chan to the town. And if I eat a burger that was already in the house it replaces it. And add some more houses, and add one that you can decorate yourself. Also add stuff so you can make your own personal character.
Stole my money When I got the game it wouldn't install so I looked to see if I could refund it and I couldnt. Dumbest game in the world
Doesn't work App force closes in Android 4.4.2 and since this is my second time trying it I can't get refund.  Don't download.
