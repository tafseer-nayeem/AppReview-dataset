Hardly opens I used the lite version with no problem. Since I purchased the full version, the game won't open about 80 of the time. It's a complete waste of money. I'll never purchase another RPG game if this is the standard. Update Obviously someone isn't concerned with customer satisfaction, either. No response to this review. Gotta love em.
Do not know what is going on, cannot catch a fish now, set the hook and fish is gone before I get a chance to fight it, I mean every time Feel like I have been cheated, don't waste your money on the full version like I have, this game is a complete ripoff, uninstalling
I want to buy stuff I would like to buy better kit but when I paid for the game because I liked it the shop had gone. Would be 5 star if fixed.
Not bad
Dislike it Good phishing game with good presentation, but no Google Play Game Features, no Google Cloud Sync, and poor back button support can't close game.
I have wasted my money. I cannot cast properly. The casting seems to work in the reverse.when reeling and tilting back lowers the rod tip Am so disapointed
Help Every time  I strike the game turns off so waste of money, not a happy bunny
Does not work After last update the game is not working...I'm not able to open the game.
Paid my money now this thing Won't open please fix I'd hate to think I just wasted my money
Too easy Good game but it's way too easy. I get a fish on every 10 seconds. There's no challenge. I've gotten bored with it quickly
