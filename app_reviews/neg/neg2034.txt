Sucks I hate this app. I can't do any setting especially the pieces highlighting possible positions. Makes the game childish especially when the Queen is tapped and the whole board is filled with queens. I hate it. If you can add settings and fix this, I may have a different opinion. I am uninstalling now.
This app is joke. How can it be so high with so many ads, crashing engine and such bad multiplier There are much better online chess apps than this.
DO NOT DOWNLOAD Worst chess app. Ever made.
Hate the game. If you want to if you want to do something cooler you should if you want to do something to her you should make it where the chess pieces actually move cuz this game sucks cuz all the chess pieces do not move I hate your game
