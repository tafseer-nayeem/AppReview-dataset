Disappointment. Yet again, there aren't many videos Plus, they take sooo long to load  Like I said before, you're better off on Youtube.
Really wish it was step by step, not youtube video linked playlist
It would've been good But everytime I tried to play a video it said no connection
I like this app but.......... It doesn't show me how to draw it says check your internet and restart this app but how to restart this app
Gay This shot is so gay
This game wont load
