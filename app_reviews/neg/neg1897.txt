It is a nice looking app but it's moon VOC timing is wrong and it does not show the start and end VOC times. As these are important to my use, I am rather disappointed. Please fix this. I have Pro version.
Didnt display major lunar event We had a Supermoon Eclipse on Sunday but this information was not conveyed in the PRO version which I purchased just so I could view this type of information. Will be uninstalling and finding a different app.
I am puzzled Why , do the settings in your app not function like the first day downloaded Fix it please , because it has potential to be a 5. With NO Support
