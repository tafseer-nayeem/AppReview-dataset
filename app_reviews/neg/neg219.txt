Some issues I don't receive an alert right away when I get a text or voicemail. I have to have the app open and waiting for a call for the call to come through. When I am on a call I can't use the number key pad. When I am on a call after a out 3 minutes I can still here the person I  talking to but they can't hear me, so they have to call me back. All this started after the last update.
WTF I kinda like it but what i hate is that whenever i have to make a call it only rings one time and than i can't hear anything, and when the person picks up none of us can't hear a thing
I use to like it but... It was working great, now it's not working at all. I cannot text anyone. Also it does not work when, I I try to call it flicker's.
Text free ultra Could have been better and it doesn't let me send messages
It will not send any of my texts. I will try to send a text, but then it SAYS IT SENDS BUT DOESNT. It has this little checkmark by it also and it never used to have that util the update. . . Weird. Please help. I need to find out how to actually send my texts because obviously it's not working.
Getting minutes does not work App works great for texting and receiving calls. When you want to add minutes by watching a video or something it crashes. I'm on a nexus 5.
still not working the app keeps crashing on me, plaza fix fast
Has to many bugs 1.It closes a lot, slow, messages take to long to send but other than that great app
I don't even get notifications anymore
Doesn't recognize my username or number anymore. It's sucks
More minutes Give us more minutes
Annoying adverts.. You guys should get serious Is there a way to get rid of All Advertisement
If I Could Vote Less I Would. This app has been giving me issues since I downloaded,  BUT I decided not to uninstall it just yet because I was thinking maybe it was my phone. Nope. Now the app doesn't work on or off WiFi and it's my only way of communication since my other phones broke... Thanks For Nothing.
