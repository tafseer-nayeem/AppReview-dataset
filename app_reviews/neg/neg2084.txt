Stupid and disappointing Awful awful story. The actual puzzle solving is good but the end is just so disappointing, as I I can't believe that's it with many expletives thrown in.  Should have saved my money. Good app if it was free.
Will I did like it and was having fun but now it won't turn on. Screen stays black. Wth. I paid for this game it should work.
I love it but.... I'm on the screen the hint tells me to go to,  but the item it says should be there is not Please Help I really don't want to have to reset progress I'd be more specific but i don't want to give away any spoilers
I really like this game, but I really hate having to wait for hints...especially since the timer only works when you're playing the game. It would also be really nice if you could just tap on a location on the map to go there instead of trying to understand the convoluted way it's set up now. Fix these and I'll give 5 stars.
Too bad The graphics and puzzles were awesome but finding my way around took the fun out of the game. Didn't bother going to winter season
Have get tile in screen 31 but there is no screen 31 wasted my money good game up till now
Didn't work at all I just bought this game today, the least you can do is make sure it works if you won't offer refunds. I am highly disappointed.  Open the game its black screen for amoment or twothe takes me home. I have uninstalled reinstalled, restarted my tablet and all else I can do still nothing.
Galaxy tab new Screen is cut off . Can't access all my inventory items as it will only show me 5 items and can't scroll to next
