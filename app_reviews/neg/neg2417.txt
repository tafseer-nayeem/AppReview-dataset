Deserves 5 stars All I get is static recording I paid for this piece of crap Wasted my money Now I'm gonna have to uninstal it
NO NOTIFICATION HIDE OPTION There is no notification hide option. There is no manual recording option. No personal lock option. Many many... waste of my pro
Not Clear or Reliable Recorded caller voice is scratchy barely recognizable. Not all calls for that selected contact records Many times the saved record is corrupt and does not play back. Using LG 3
Having some calls not recorded even they look like they did, getting worse
Don't pay, doesn't record all conversations about 20 fail While switching conversation the app does not record
Can't get recordings into Pro I upgraded to the Pro version to be able to save recordings I had made to my Google Drive account. But when I upgraded the recordings from the free version did not go into the pro version, and I can't find a way to transfer them over. If you can fix this I'll be happy to change my rating, because I liked it up to this point.
No Auto Backup to Google Drive I paid for this app because of this promised feature, but it's not working...
Not working at all.. faint.
