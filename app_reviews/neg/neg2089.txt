VERY DISSATISFIED The game keeps reseting my scores. No matter how hard I try, the game resets itself as if it's a new install. I'm tired of dealing with it and doing the same tile set ups over and over again. I wish I could get my money back for this stupid game, but it's been too long. DON'T BUY THIS GAME  WASTE OF MONEY
