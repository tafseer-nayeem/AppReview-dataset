Offline Life I really like zapya from the 1st.. The new update add feature for social connect that I don't like..also the chat option.. me  my friends only use zapya for file transfer, not for chat or social..that i dislike. in this version after transfer complete pop up appear for recommend suggestion for other social friends .. its not cool at all.. we want zapya to be simple just like old versions ... remove recommendation  features apps. its getting more annoying.
