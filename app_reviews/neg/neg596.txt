Can't mute sound Would've given a higher rating but I can't listen to my own music while playing this, which is a huge factor for me, Please fix this
Very lacking in content Love the game, love the idea, it was really enjoyable for the hour I played it before he content ran out.
Too simple The game is just over simplified ... I guess this is a side effect of smartphone gaming where games needs to be playable even if you are an infant. The only redeeming thing about this game is the price otherwise I would have given it a zero. Oh yeah even the sound track sucks
