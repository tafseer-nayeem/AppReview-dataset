I paid for this I expected more choices,  this should be a free starter kit.  Please add more to make it worth paying for,  the I will give higher rating.  Thank you.
Does not work. I paid the .9 9 cents for this app. And it doesn't work. It always has am error message.  Please refund me my money, fix the issue or replace it with  another app. Thank you.
When you pay a buck, you don't expect only a few characters and half I can't use because they are distinctly Catholic. Poor marketing. Should have called them Catholic emoji. Also, you cant insert them into a text that is already typed, you have to choose them before typing. I give it a thumbs down for ease of use and lack of substance. Very disappointed
No way to use on social media I got this because none of the smilies in my phone reflect my faith.  But these can't be pulled up when posting on social media galaxy s5 user and also, they're way too large and goofy looking.  Disappointed. 
help how do i add it to facebook or my messaging app
I want my refund. Thank you.
DOUBT Most Of Their Faces Seem To Be Showing Doubt, Mostly Due To How You Have Their Lips. More Catholic Emojis Than Anything. Gonna Call It Christian, Add Some.
not enough smiles for the price 
I couldn't believe that you only get 8. I was really disappointed.
