Once Great, Feels Like An Afterthought Now The refresh glitch still happens after how many times that it's been reported in the community No material makeover after over a year of the promise too.
Lacks a lot of features The notifications aren't very swift,also the app lacks a lot of notification features the original twitter app has, overall not the best experience but I can see this app improving and hopefully it will
Picture import needs work Pictures imported from gallery are rotated 180 degrees, whereas pictures taken within app are fine. What gives After latest Update Now  it's even worse...tweets fail to post with more than one pic attached. Wtf guys
Cannot update Cannot update. Readding account doesn't work. Pls fix this, moto x 2014.
I used to love this app but it has been rather fussy for me in the last few months. Tweets will not send if it has a picture attached and syncingupdating stops whenever I switch from Wifi to cellular or back, that requires a forced stop to get it to start working again. Right now the standard Twitter app is becoming my daily app as it works reliably, but full of promoted tweets...blah.
I'd like a refund App frequently fails to post tweets even when on WiFi. This has happened 5 times since I bought it less than 3 hours ago.
When will the pole option come When will the pole option come.  You are not matching the pace.  Earlier I gave 5 stars.  Now you deserve 2 stars.  I will give 5 stars again when features will match twitter official
Direct messaging doesn't work
