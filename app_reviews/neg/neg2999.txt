Was working fine.. It worked fine until about 10 minutes ago, won't stop exiting me out of apps to pop up pointless ads This is very annoying and if it continues I will uninstall. I've restarted my phone twice and the problem hasn't stopped.
Paid for this ugh Its does notify Me on messages properly anymore kitkat4.4
Refund I bought this twice... Once in December last year, and once again recently. I applied for the refund in the app settings and it said refunded. But my account still has the same amount of money in it as before. I want my refund. So I emailed the developer and I have yet to receive and email back. As for I launcher, I love it. I loved it enough to buy it twice. But the developer has horrible customer support.
bad icon the old icons was good than the new one, the new one doesn't looks like iphone icons, i would like to give 5 stars, please develop the screen locker and control panel too. however, the app was cool 
Dock turns white on HTC One M8 Pretty pointless to use this, I can't even see my apps on the dock.
Not much customization. Search does not work. It crashes launcher Nexus 6P Android 6.0 Marshmallow.
