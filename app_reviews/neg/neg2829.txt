Can't export   so there's no meaning on art working... Please add the feature of exporting art work to standard format JPEG or PNG....... Then you can get 5 Stars. Without this feature this app has no value.
Noooo I saved more than 15 drawings but only two are left... I pressed save to gallery for all and saw the notification saying saved to gallery. I was hoping to have them for special plans.
Keeps restarting Hay I like the look of the app but I cannot use it it opens loads then restarts and stays in a restart loop cannot even get into settings.......no reply from the dev team also other pplz have had the same issue and dev does not seem to be interested in fixing the issue I am removing the app
Why can't I save my creations I think this app is wonderful but useless at the same time I tried to save an image three times but when I search for it in my gallery the photo is not there
Y'all suck My sister uses this to draw and she drew an awesome picture she saved it multiple times and by multiple I mean like 29 times she worked for a really long time on it and all the sudden it wasn't there. I'd give you a negative 5 star if I could. Either you need to secure your users drawing profile so people don't come in steal them or you need to make sure your program is working
Kudos, but... Alot better than mobile X version too the layers part is what made the diff but those who buy sketchbook pro cannot find back the same app in play store and have to pay again for a new app called Autodesk Sketchbook.
Not as good I had an older version on a different tablet that worked SOOOO much better and was perfect for me but i updated it and everything turned to, well, this. I havent used it since. I just redownload it to try it again but still doesnt work with me. I prefer the old style much better. So much easier. I cant even download the older verson so im screwed. Thanks.
