Really The characters dont even work on ANY of my devices. My cousin can use them on his Ipad.... PLEASE FIX I reallywl want to use the characters.
Has its issues Update Now I can't log in. When logging in, you will be greeted with a crash on multiple ocassions. Sometimes the app will go black and the phone will become unresponsive for a minute after it freezes. Also, sometimes sending a message, it'll suddenly go offline. Only way to come back on is to log back in again. If you're in a video call, and your phone goes to standby with the screen turning off, then you can't use any of the buttons.Onlyendcall
Can Tablets have the same advantages Android Tablets don't get characters. I would really like them. Thank you for reading my comment.
