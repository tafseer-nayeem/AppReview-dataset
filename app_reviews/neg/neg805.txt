Fix it. It used to work great on my iPhone now I have a galaxy s4 and had to repay for it and it don't even work it says network connection.
Imikimi Nothing comes in except the staff picks. I look up frames and it says no kimi. And its always saying check my internet connection. I paid 99 cents for this and I appreciate it if u will fix it. Nothing is wrong with my internet PLEASE FIX THIS BEFORE I ASK FOR A REFUND
Purchased I bought this app. Upgraded it and now categories don't work,search don't work, and new frames don't work... Fix it now or I want my money back I love this app. It's my favorite and I won't use any other app. If you fix it I'll give you five stars. For now I gave you one....
