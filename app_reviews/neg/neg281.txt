Not moveable to SD card. This app caches a lot of data.  Too bad it cannot be moved to SD card...
Imgur links do not work Imgur links do not load. Only works if I load it via a browser. I have to uninstall and reinstall this app to make imgur work.
Last update broke this app Viewed threads still appear as though I haven't clicked on them yet. They used to be highlighted if already viewed. PLEASE FIX
Imgur albums cause the app to crash Every time I open an imgur album, the app crashes. No idea why, but very annoying. Just updated, still no fix yet
Concept is great but it crashes like crazy, especially on Imgur albums. I'm uninstalling. Huge disappointment and waste of money.
Used to be great App randomly stopped loading pages.  Now it won't reinstall.
