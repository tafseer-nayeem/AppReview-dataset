Too short Is OK, but for this expense I expected a Lot more longevity or interaction. Won't be buying the sequels at this price.
Underwhelming Got through it in about an hour and a half maybe. Dialogue was simple and uninteresting. Very bland and definitely not the masterpiece some make it seem. Definitely not worth the money.
VERY short for the price Would rate 5 stars if it cost .99 The game is a lot of fun. However, for how much it costs it is far too short. I finished it in maybe 2 hours total including quite a few rewinds.
Glitchy Cannot open my spell book ever time I try it force closes the game please fix I was having fun
Great style and graphics but terrible story
Cant even take my first step. I have given this a 1 star because i cant give it 0. I have paid for this game and have been waiting to play it after reading the reveiws. I go to start my journey and as soon as i tap on my character the game stops working. I will change my stars onceif i can play it some time soon please help.
