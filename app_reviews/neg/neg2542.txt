It doesn't work for PE Every time I try to get my skin it says 'That is not a skin silly'
DOESN'T WORK I tried this app, but it doesn't work for me anymore If you fix this I will give you 5 stars.
Help Please make like iOS version, much better there. We pay for less but they get more for free
Doesn't work I created a skin and uploaded it and chose browse and said that's not a skin silly
Requires other apps to work. It's junk. Why exactly does this app run at start up and why does it need to run in the backround It's fishing... deleted app
