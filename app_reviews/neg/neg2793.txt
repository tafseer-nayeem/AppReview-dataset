Just didn't work for me.
Pointless Nothing like wheel of fortion and is stupid and boring
Game closes out unexpectedly or doesn't open up at all.
Very buggy Get the app working before release. This is Google's fault.
Boring... put two players
Stupid Stupid

Boring So dull.
No fun
Ads GalORE
Boring Stupid. I closed out an add and it restarded
Ugh Downloaded the game, tried to open it and it kept force closing. Uninstalling.
Horrible App doesn't work it just keeps crashing.
Guess what Boring and lame
Wheel of fun Would be fun if it worked.the key pad don't work you have to push it many times. An the ads at the bottom of the screen will not stop so half the wheel is covered. Sorry I had so much trouble.
Couldn't play Don't download this game, as soon as u open it an ad pops up then closes the app waist of time
Game sucks Very boring pointless. Don't waste time or memory.
Horrible This game is a joke. You can't buy vowels. There is no instructions. You just keep playing the same one over and over if you don't guess it right. Waste of space.
It froze up on 301 and I uninstalled it and installed and it put me back at level 1
Wheel of Fortune I'm totally disappointed
Wheel of fun yea right more like wheel of ads
