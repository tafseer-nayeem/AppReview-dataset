This app doubles the hours of battery life you have left It says I have 15 hrs. When it only lives for about 79. Yea. Not very accurate.
Explain.. Why Initially, it was working normal. But after updating it to the last version, it began going wrong...precisely.. There began appearing 1620 apps turned on when i was optimizing phone.. even i was making it every 1520 minutes..I hadn't such problem before.. However, its good app.. I hope u will fix it
We have been noticing a lot of problems occurring after we downloaded this app. We are experiencing our batteries dying much quicker than normal. Our phones have been lagging behind really bad and we have been getting a lot pop ups and its causing our phones to act up. I'm deleting the app and I wouldn't recommend to any other Android users. And it constantly running, is eating away at our data and costing us extra money every month.
Look at the things it want access too Want to be able to take picturesvideos want to reroute outgoing calls look at everything you do even edit or delete contacts and texts this app is really dodgy its a hack nothing else
GARBAGE Do not waste storage on this useless, annoying app if you own a Samsung galaxy avant.  Absolute piece of crap...
After the update Slow charge.. inaccurate percentage charge..  etc.. when i charge my phone it was 20 and about 3045 minutes it say 8090 then i reboot my phone it back tu 3040 .. please fix it..  thank you
Every time ... I open any app, I get an annoying notification to optimize my phone. Even after I just optimized it.
Used to be good I have been using this app for a while now. When I first started using it out seemed to work well. Every update seems to add more ads and worse performance the latest update has my phone freezing time to Uninstall and use greenify. Phone is much snappier after I uninstalled
