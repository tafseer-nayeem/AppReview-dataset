Gambled on it Only 77p worth a go NO waste of money steering terrible and you have no brakes the car going flat out and you try and steer nothing happens or very little pish poor
Last update ruined it Always just closes even when not open, have you fixed this yet
Dont buy What a waste of money.. cant even turn right...
Terrible controls Every time I touch the middle of the screen the car turns.  Really stupid control system.
Steering is nice Too bad you can't do it in this game
Crashing
Too many bugs
Can't turn right Junk
Not bad. The steering controls are not good. .its quite hard to take a left turn please fix..not worth the price waste of money...
Mario Brothers meets racing Waited to long to play because I trusted Codemasters to produce a quality racer. Now I won't be able to get a refund... This game needs an actual driving view... either a chase cam or cockpit view... This is like racing meets Mario Brothers... I  expected more from Code masters...
Ripoff.. You must earn or buy the ability to unlock races beyond the second race at 1.96 each. This is a ripoff, considering how foolishly difficult it is to unlock with stars...
Worst game for rs 125. I want my money back. Please don't download this game.
Very bad It started up once fine has its does where it doesn't want to start. The graphics are nice and the controls also to say initially I paid 1.20 then I play two races then you have to pay 1.20 again for an season or 3.45 for all of them for all teams disappointed I wasted my money
Really really dreadful Honestly, this is just about the worst  game I have seen, not least because the steering just doesn't work, and that's rather important in a racing game.
