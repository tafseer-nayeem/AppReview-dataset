Loaded trying to sell me different things to do This game would not play it kept trying to get me to play other games and dwelled on Facebook who the hell wants Facebook.
liar they said u dont have to have wifi to play this game but you do . . what a crock of sh . . this is false advertisement
Starts out interestingly enough But quickly shows you will need to spend money to progress.  And don't dream you can enjoy it without friends.  And btw, devs, sharks, skates and rays are live birthers, not egg layers.
Not even close to real Its a fun game but not even close to real you get tired way to fast and reels break way to easy no way a fish would destroy a reel that easy your line would snap before that ever happen i mean it like whoever designed this game has never been fishin before sad to say but uninstall is on the way
This game keeps kicking me off every time I put money on there why would it keep doing that. I would think if you want people to keep playing the game I think you need to fix this problem so we can enjoy it
Was great but stopped loading I enjoyed playing but game has stopped loading and when I do get it to load I can no longer get to fish. Freezes on loading.
