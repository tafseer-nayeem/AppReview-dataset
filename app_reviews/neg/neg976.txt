Too many options Straight up there needs to be a simpler mode that also auto sets each night. This is key. Auto set each night. Can't emphasize this enough lol
Keeps switching back to trial I have purchased the app, but currently sleep tracking only works occasionallyit keeps saying trial expired. Please let me know if anyone can help
It used to work perfectly I think I've had this app for over two years now, but lately it doesn't seem to be working anymore, specifically since the second week of January, the alarm part of it doesn't even sound sometimes which was one of my favorite parts of the app. I think I've missed around 3 classes now cause it won't wake me up, which is so not cool. Idk what's wrong with it, but I might have to change apps for one I can rely on. The problem now is it hasn't even made a sound all week.
Not working Anyone else having issues with this app Sometimes for me it doesnt produce any sounds and lately for me it keeps turning itself off.  I've been late a few times now because of it.
Problem with Android 6.0 Nexus 6P Alarm didnt ring at all, until i press the on button, it started to ring. It must be because of the doze mode. Im using the nexus 6P. Ive sent you a bug report and i hope it will be resolve really soon but for now, im going to rate this application 1 star
Problems I purchase this a while ago, and it worked just wonderfully. However, I had to uninstall and reinstall because of my device and now it doesn't recognize that I have purchased it. On the main screen I am told that I only have 12 days left of my testing. I hit the purchase button and I am taken to download the key, where it shows that I have already purchased it. I hit open from here and I am taken to a thankyou splash page, and then back to where I am told that I have not purchased it.8
