All world's are locked except 2 world  don't fool by saying this game is free  and there is no option to exit this game
Terrible My 4 year old loves the game. However, there is no point in collecting the coins. You still have to pay for new cars and levels. He becomes bored very quickly.
Good
NO STARS I paid for all levels to be unlocked and no ads. Then updated now it doesn't work and it my money. If there was no stars that's what I'd rate it
Will not work This game keeps saying unexpected error every time I try to open it. Even tried reinstalling still doesnt work
Error I have to uninstall this app because it keeps crashing. Does not work.
Supposed to be for kids. Filled with ads that are inappropriate. Don't bother
