Horrible I rated it 1 star but I wish I cold have rat tree d it 0. Don't even waste your time because it keeps freezing on multiplayer and hard level.I used to think it was fun but its not.  It is the worst game ever.
For me it is more like a rage game, the hard and insane difficulties are just to much for me, it annoyes me so much. The controls in my opinion are not the worst but they are definetely not the best, not even close. If you play with your friend, well, that's something else, it can be fun, but not for me
It was a way better before. Two years gone since I did play this game last time and I've found that developers had only changed in the game amount and size of commercials. That sucks.
OMG never get and do  not  play single player on normal gt he just keeps on scoring  makes me mad  do not get it 
Easy peasy lemon squeasy I beat it in insane mode in 198 minutes
gud game easy to play hard to master you are right...  this is nice game for time pass but if you add multiplayer mode by Bluetooth or wifi it will be more real and more fun where we can challenge our friends and cheer out after goal...  all tough nice game 2 star for now waiting for your update with multiplayer device...
NOPE Im not saying I dislike it actually I am but I dont think you should not this is just my opinion
This game is not all that I played and I beat it you can only get a score of 7 that's it you win, but you either start over or quit there's no next level nothing if there was it might be more fun, where's the challenge in that. Its safe to say I'm deleting this app.
Aisyah cool guy I have this game but i delete this game and im so bord because i play clash of clan soi want downloud this gamw.OMG Is dont.bye.peice yoo guys
