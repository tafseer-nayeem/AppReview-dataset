Inflation Greedy scum. Paid version didn't pay enough. Now more coins needed for power ups. You suck.
Frustrated with repeated failures and lack of customer service I am frustrated with the lack of feedback and repeated comments of an unexpected error occurred and we're working to fix it. I paid for the  no advertisements version and wish I had not.
Last update sucks. Stole over half my coins. And now I have won 5 games and it doesn't credit my the coins I have won.
Ads Hello, I purchased a no as version.  I consider in game promotion to be an ad.
Paid version feels just like the adridden version So many unnecessary taps They never stop nagging you to share your scores link the app to facebook even if you declined to do so on initial launch. They are constantly forcing you to tap okay or play, probably remnants from the ad supported version, to encourage accidental taps on adverts. The questions are written poorly, or perhaps not translated properly from some other language to english.
