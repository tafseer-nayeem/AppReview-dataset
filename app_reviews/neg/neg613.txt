Garbage Literally got a 9 out of 150 in first song because after 10 seconds of playing, it cut to an advertisement and then never went back to the song. If I could give this app zero stars I would.
Doesn't work Would be nice if the game worked on my Huawei G620. I'd think a quadcore 1.2ghz with 1gb ram would have been enough...
Not synchronized Button smash not synchronized with the song...but it really look like a guitar hero game console. I hope you can fix the consq...
Sucks It sucks really bad and it's soo lame and sorry...hate it
Started out ok but really an app will pop up in the middle of your song. Wow way to screw people over
Expected way more I don't how this got a million downloads. There are so many ads and share options it's almost like the developer is trying to survive off this game. There isn't even any menu music and the songs sometimes don't match the notes.
POOR GAMING I tried to play this but when i play it sucks the tabs wont move its just moving upward and downward. Uninstalling this app
It kinda sucks that the music still plays even when I'm messing up.
Crap Adds pop up in the middle of you playing and make you miss notes.
Ads Ads will pop up during a song.
Wow... Don't waste the time or the space on your device...Boooo
Boooooo Totally cuts to an add 10 seconds in to a song. Very annoying. Immediate delete.
Prefer to play the real thing on my ps2
Sucks Wow to play an advertisement while youre playing.
Doesnt count correctly when I tap the xcreen
Sucks Really An ad in the middle of playing a song This game is a motherfudging piece of shishcabob
Ads keep screwing me up Every time I try to play it Messrs up because of ads
Don't get it The app spam is real
Lmfao This game sucks balls
Not worth the time To many adds I can't believe you have this many adds that interrupted the game very disappointed I will never download one of your games again
Ads Ads pop up in middle of the game horrible app
