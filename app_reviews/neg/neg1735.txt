Scrap Just installed it. Clicked on know your fare. By default the city is New Delhi, no issues with that but when I try to enter from and to, there's a blank screen and out you go. Tried thrice the same. I mean, common, atleast make an app that works. I think the guys below, giving you a 4 rating, may be your employees, tryin to say I downloaded inspite of all the negative reviews and am happy. No one can be happy with such an app. Scrap.....
DONT DOWNLOAD IT U ask for our email id for free rides . It is ur trick . Poor useless app . Cant book a cab on it .
Feeling cheated. There is no such offer you are just sharing your referral code, this is not fair.My concern is that there is no benefit to the existing users.I could definitely give you good rating had I been given some benefit be it free rides or discounts because I'm already a existing customer.
Ullu banane ka scheme The maker of the app has only given his federal codes on his app and no other offer.
Waste app Comparative rates are not coming quickly whatever we type jaipur city rates only coming
Useless App Guys dont download the app there is no offer.. Useless no free ride.. Fake app
Pathetic Have some standards guys Extremely unuser friendly app.
