Clean, but puzzles not that great The first puzzle was great as a starter and fairly easy. The second had me stumped for a bit, but was fun to work through and figure out. When I got to the third, the clues were so riddled with a ... who is not ... who is not ... etc. I had to skip it. The next puzzle's clues started fine, but again had the same horrible clue structure I couldn't take it. Not worth my time playing if the games are horribly worded.
Its OK. The game starts off pretty difficult but is made even harder by poor grammar. Sentence structure could use work. I'm just saying that logic puzzles are hard enough without me having to approach my friends to debate the meanings of the clues. Get rid of brackets Split your clues up so its not 4 clues mashed together with double negatives, commas and parenthesis.
Meh You only get a few puzzles before being asked to pay
