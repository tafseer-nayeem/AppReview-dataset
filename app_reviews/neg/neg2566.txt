Awful lag Ok so i had this game on my ipod 5 and I loved it. I got a galaxy s4 and just had to download this game again. On my ipod it was very smooth operation but on my galaxy it has major lag. I Uninstalled alot of game to open up memory. I disabled quite a few apps to boost my phone. Nothing has helped. If you can fix the lag then I'll be more than happy to rate 5 stars and continue playing.
Seems like a fun game but... It crashes after beating the introductory level. I'm using a Nexus 6. Hope it gets fixed soon.
Its awesome...but it kinda isn't, Its a great game and all, but once I got to day, maybe, 65 it started getting bubby. Every time I'm doing too many thing at once the patty's don't cook.THEN it doesn't let me go anywhere to the other stations. Then I have to quit and start all over again with the same problem.
Refund I want a refund for the burgeria to go, but the others are awesome
Needs update I have bought everything and level 57 now and their is nothing to buy please add more thing's so the game can be even better cause its getting boring making money but not able to buy anything unstalling now
