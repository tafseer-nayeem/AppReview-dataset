you suck I'm giving 1 star because I can't give 0. I've never noticed this till today and you are negative 5 right now. I have a photo I want to share, And I can't because four freaking years ago my sister shared it too so I had to download anooooottthhhhheerrrrrrr app to get to share the photo. negative 5 stars, I am deleting timehop right NOW AND WILL NEVER USE AGAIN UNLESS YOU TELL ME YOU HAVE FIXED THIS PROBLEM. ohhhhhh okay so now I updated it and it just won't work  yeah y'all suck
disappointed i used to like this app. but after i update it, i can no longer view my posts 2 years and up. 
I am no longer using this app I used to love this app now twice a week I get a error saying come back later. Seriously this sucks because then I never get to see anything for that day. I feel like it is only me having this issue.
Won't show me any Facebook posts from the past. Lately I haven't received any Facebook updates. I know things were posted because Facebook has been letting me know. Really wish this would get fixed. I emailed about this and still haven't received a response.
Doesn't work, say's no previous fb posts show via timehop but when I scroll on fb to the date of a year or 2 years ago their should be something to show everyday. Will uninstall.
Won't load Error messages Stop  playing favorites. Please give us stickers and frames and such
Ridiculous. The ONE day a year I really do want to see my throwbacks and they won't even load. Ridiculous. It's updated several times and for what Nothing has changed. Very upset, Timehop.
Please tell me the app is a day behind today it's showing memories from yesterday shouldn't it be showing memories from the day that it is I may have to uninstall the app again because it seems to keep screwing up
Dropbox photos don't appear It shows they are there but it's just an empty gray box
Updates It's crappy that iPhone users have better share options where you can add cute stuff my android doesn't get that. Super bummed about that .
