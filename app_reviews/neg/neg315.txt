Recently this app has taken to playing the Plan B contraceptive ad before playing your station. It does this completely taking over your phone, forcing you to watch the ad. You can't even get to your home screen until iHeart Radio let's you. Not cool, regardless of the ad contents. Then old  oversaturated PSAs, and informational filler ads which seem to be written by illiterates. Please guys, step up your game Hire educated people, fix your technical, and LISTEN to your own network.
Good  but... Its really good i love all my stations but a big problem i face is that this app is extremely slow, for example if i click on a station and there's a song i dislike I'll usually go to a different radio but when i try to click on the next station the whole screen just freezes for like 10 seconds and it's really annoying. Please Fix
