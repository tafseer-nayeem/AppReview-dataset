Requires internet. It can be a good time waster but it can be frustrating.
I hate it I love the princess the boy is ok it is borring lame all you do is put paths in the right place then  you make them walk lame borring stupid don't down lode this game
Just wanted to play it and then I find out you have to pay real money per level. Really great game but there's no way I can afford it.
Good concept but.. Just as I'm getting into the game I find out that I need to pay to unlock full game.. Major turn off, and the irony is I would have paid for this game, but I'd rather not be surprised by any other pay to unlock options later.
Good, but... The game is great and all.... But its a shame that you have to pay to actually play with ease...I hope you guys make a free one
Game problem When I run the game it does            close. How can I fix it
Terrible IT DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY AT ALL AND I HAD TO DOWNLOAD GOOGLE PLAY GAMES FOR NOTHING.......
Don't like this game I got to a part in the FREE game where it said I had to pay 1.99 to continue. I find this is silly as the game is FREE  Why let me only play two or three levels then make me pay If it was really FREE I would have kept it.
This game sucks I only played 3 lvls and it asked for money for more lvls on that stupid game NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS STUPID GAME
Not free After 3 levels the game demands  its entertainment value is ok.
DONT INSTALL This game allows you 2 or 3 levels, then forces you to buy more if you want to continue playing.
Fun but... Its hard to move around
Boring. Don't waste your time on this free game.
Sorry but I thought it was 3d and it boring don't ever download
Too few levels then pay to play on, I think not.
