Waste of money, for me at least, we've had snow at least twice, not much but it snowed, not only did this app say no snow it didn't even show the snow on the radar, every other weather app I have showed it on the radar and I'm in NY long island so for me it sucks and since I paid I'm stuck with it
Waste of 2.99 If you already have the NOAA HD Radar this is simply a waste of money. Same exact app but this one pretends to predict the snowy future. DO NOT BUY THIS APP
Going down All it does now is ask for rating  even after leaving one.  Way to ruin an app.
Has not been correct yet Close but no cigar. At least for our area Pacific NW it's not worth the price.
Should be free No different than free weather apps
Crashed OS The application continually caused the OS on the Dell Tablet I was using to crash.
