Piano master I thought I would get at least one good song with the starter pack for 2.99 but all I got was junk and if I want something decent its .99 cent per song, and the game sucks Any programming student could have done better. This is a money making scheme and nothing more.
Some of the keys don't play Dissapointed keys will not play on sony z2 xperia d,b and f keys have no sound. Please fix
Dislike it Good piano game with good presentation, but no Google Play Game Features, no Google Cloud Sync, and misleading advertising says full version, but it isn't.
Not all notes working on Sony please fix
Don't works with Sony Doesn't works with my Sony z3
Needs fixed You can't hear some of the notes when played I really like the app but a waste of my money if not fixed soon
