Downloads over mobile Data when turned off. Did not even warn me. Until I got notification saying it's complete  it was already downloaded.... I just went to play it. Not for the first time
Not opening... The app is not opening its saying you need a license verification. I don't understand.
Wish it worked Love the franchise but this game has so many bugs. Even on my s6 it runs terrible and for whatever reason i often get my turn skipped. Loading ip often shows big white blocks instead of team 17 logo. Sad.
Notification error I recently upgraded to a galaxy s6 sprint and when playing online, I don't receive notifications, when its my turn, like I did on my old galaxy s4
Would be 5 Worms games have always been some of the best multiplayer games. This one with asynchronous game play is top notch. This would get 5 stars but still has glitches where i can't continue a game and have to restart with my friend. Also I no longer get notified of my turn. It's set to show notifications but doesn't. Will get 5 if fixed.
Failure to Download 3x ive tried to down with storage space of 1GB, 3x it gets to 48 then cancels download due to and error 909 code, despite 3bar 3G signal. Totally useless, giving up. Fix immediately and i will reconsider downloading
Not offline Can't play without internet connection. That sucks. Fix that and i'll rate 5 stars.  Edit after reply and what if the game wants to check its license when you are on holiday abroad without internet You're screwed for the remainder of the trip. Again, please fix that.
Love the game, hate the bugs Soo many corrupt games all the time.. super disappointing to have a game break all the time. When a game works, the games play is awesome, and the game modes are a lot of fun.
Won't open since the last update Hence why the 1 ...  I will increase it once you've fixed all this... All it says to me is downloading failed because the resources could not me found on the Worms 3 loading page... SORT IT OUT
