NO idea how this app works.. Not user friendly at all.. Also when using the search it doesnt give any info on what ive searched.. Uninstalling.. Better to use from Google..
Waste app Pls don't download this app no use from this waste of time and data
Worst job app ever, do not download .don't even think of downloading this app Useless, no use, people download app to make things easy, but this app complicated everything, instead of giving the user benefit of knowing where is vacancy it keeps it a secret n asks to login to other website through the app. Heights of idioticmess
Can't change settings Like the idea of quick searches, but you can't change any of the settings. Can't stop push notifications, can't change country. Rubbish app
A very bad app. When you open a job for the description,  it gives you a totally different job.
Does not show anything. Just says PAGE NOT FOUND. Bunch of balogna
