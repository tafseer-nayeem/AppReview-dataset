Freezings problem My kids love this game but, freezing problem ruined the whole gaming experience. Could you please fix this problem and until then refund me please Thanks.
Can't update My daughter loves this game but it won't let me update it and won't let her play it because it needs to be updated. Please fix the problem so she can play it. That is why I only gave it one star. If it worked right I would have given it a five star. Please help my daughter wants to play but I can't install the game.I paid for it and now can't play it
Dubious Permissions Permissions requested give developers ability to identify phone and serial number. This is more intrusive and different to the other Dr Panda titles I have for my daughter.  Developers please explain.
