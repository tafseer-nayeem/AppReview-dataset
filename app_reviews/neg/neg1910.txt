Premium I got the free app and liked it, so I bought the pro app for full functionality. Now it's telling me that, to get reports and full function, I need to go premium. What a joke. Uninstalled.
 Uses large amount of battery may be 45  within 30 to 40 min.  This app doesn't show step count of the walk which should have been integral part of this app. For steps they provide one more pro app.  ridiculous 
How to get in touch with customer service I have the pro version and bought even some training programs...  The last one doesn't seem to synch...  So frustrating  i do the run and the app says not done  can someone please contact me from customers service
Distance tracking.is off I have had this app for a few months and recently it is giving me.different mileage on the same.rums. The worst was today where it.said I ran 4.4 miles for the same.route that was 4 miles about 10 days ago. I want my.money back.
Same run every time I run 8km 3 times a week. The same route to the meter. Runtastic has never counted the same distance. From 7500m to 8200. Its very disappointing...
Getting worse each update It would lose gps signal in the middle of the busy main road where the free version is working fine,wtfhappened to me thrice in a week,regret buying the pro,uninstalling and look for better alternative..
