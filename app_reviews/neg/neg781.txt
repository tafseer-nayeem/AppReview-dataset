Presenter View I had the previous version of this app. And now since the update all I can have is presenter view. I can not change out of it. Besides this HUGE complaint of that not being a changeable option it's a great tool that u use all of the time. I am disappointed with Microsoft taking a backwards step with this change. I hope this rating would would be taken into consideration by the developers of this app. Thank you, from a not as pleasedsatisfied user.
It demands me internet connection. Can't access my presentations offline. It's better to use office Suit.
Most disgusting app I have ever used. This app version is really horrible as it do not saves the required file. I used it first time today and I'll make sure never to use Microsoft PowerPoint app version again in future and waste my time.
Atrocious Was unable to follow three lectures due to the need to authenticate online and to update without asking me. Slow and cumbersome.
Its been so hard on how to sign in....I've been using my fb account but ms powerpoint doesn't recognize it..
Wont run Says Not enough space. My phone still has 1GB of free app storage space available. 4GB plus internal storage available.
This app isn't compatible with my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 from Tmobile. I have to download it from the Samsung App store, and therefore I cannot have the Office Insider program on my Phone.
