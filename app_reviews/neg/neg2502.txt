Isn't working properly I have the galaxy S6 and there seems to be something wrong with selecting questions, answers and anything to do with touching the screen. I'll click one category and receive another, I choose a correct answer and then the screen reads I chose incorrectly, the correct answer is the answer I chose. It makes the game not only not fun to play but impossible. I've tried playing with a stylus but it did the same thing.
Sooo boring This game is sooooo boring..there's not even a final jeopardy Sucks that I paid for this thinking it would be a good game..don't waste your money
Keeps shuting off This game won't let me get to double jeopardy, when switching from one level to the second its kicks me out saying the game quit.  Very disappointed.
I HATE IT I'm very upset I payed 1.99 for it....I'm not sure how it could be better but it just sucks Don't waste your money, I've only played it twice and get so frustrated I don't even finish the game
