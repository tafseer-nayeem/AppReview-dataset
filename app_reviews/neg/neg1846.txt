Has much work needed Instructions are cut off and also behind ads.  Couldnt get past the tutorial even though I pieced together how to play.
If I could rate no stars I would. No instructions
Makes no sense unituitive and no tutorial
Don't get the jump button
Add covers up how to play
Horrible Horrible, so small on my screen, tutorial literally doesn't say anything. Controls suck.
Controls Are unresponsive and awkward for just three moves.
No instructions
Don't down load it Its a boring game and the screen is so little that you can't even see what you're doing.
Stupid retarded makes no sense
