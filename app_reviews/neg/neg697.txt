Some improvement and make it more easy to use..make it more real.. It surely does a helpful app but it looks like a clay that it over stretch,make the body parts more accurate,please put some stretch limit with those body parts like as how true human body only can do..coz when i draw i always want it accurate as my body. And oh the fingers please have a button that moves all five fingers at once ..please make it worth it ..but it was still a very helpul app thanks
8 Yeah right buddy Nowhere near enough control and an awful interface.  It's not bad, but it's not worth 8 to me.  Refunded. You need way more features to justify that price
