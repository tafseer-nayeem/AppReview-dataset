Why am I still getting ads with Pro So annoying I have had pro for more than a year now and still get the pop up ads right when I'm using it, so my finger clicks on the ad and I'm taken away from what I'm working on into the browser. It keeps telling me to update to Pro to avoid the ads, BUT I HAVE PRO Get rid of the ads
Awful Use to LOVE it and not to mention I paid for this and now it takes three days to get ONE like. And thats all. My profile is not private and I am waiting weeks it just doesn't work. DON'T PAY FOR THIS. ITS A RIPOFF.
Doesn't Work I uploaded this app a few weeks ago and it does nothing for me. I was hoping the developer could fix it for me, but he hasn't responded to my email.
Not that good. This doesn't even get me 5 likes and im really concerned about this. Y'all should really fix this.
Fix It only works for a few weeks. I have to uninstall and then install to get more likes. Fix soon
Paid advertising Why have me pay then still plug the hell out of your own pages by hiding within tags. You should pay ME to advertise Stick with free version. No difference.
 This is not that good. It just does the same as the normal. Im lucky to get likes
Error on paste Always get an error when I paste and try to save to instagram if I type it in it works fine seems like they are blocking it
Refund I paid for it and I was hoping to have some new tags, but no new tags. Can I get a refund
It's okay. Barely gives me any likes Fix please.
Not workin After the update still not werkin..  It used to be working pretty well... but not anymore
Hmm For me having to pay for this I did not get the outcome I thought it was going to be. I have a likes app that's free in the Google play store that works better and am still using.
