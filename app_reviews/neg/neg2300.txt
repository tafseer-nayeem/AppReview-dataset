Cant play it Can't turn off the vibration. Calibration is off
Sadly... Great on the PC but calibration tool was poor. Cant enjoy an otherwise great game.
Seemed cool ...but Calibration is off and I can't calibrate it. I attempted it twenty times and it always said I was too inconsistent. There was a lag between when I pressed and when it registered the 'x' and it was super inconsistent with the delay...
