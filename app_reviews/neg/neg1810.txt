You lost another star... Why is a games shortcut created on my homescreen after every update That is invasive advertising. I install 360, NOT some games advertisement. I've had this app for almost 2 years and in the last couple months your advertising has gotten out of had. TONE IT DOWN I don't mind seeing ads when i open your app but that should be the only time i see them.
Taking my Stars back No more working for me Need Automatically boost Mobile If You Give option For Automatic booster I will Give You The Sky Full Of million Stars 
Game booster...... Rubbishhhh..... hate u..... u lost your worth by annoying ppl by this bullshit ad..... it appears again n again after every 5 secondss.... just rubbish.... clean mater is best.. they r not cheap business men...
It was great Now you have the pop up ad asking if I find pop up ads annoying. Yes you suck right now. If u keep it up I will Uninstall.  102315 I emailed the screen shot.  112415 still popping up. I am uninstalling
Worthless I take my stars back. It tries to take over my phone by changing the settings. Also everytime I install an app it says blah blah blah is safe by 360 security, it gets on my nerves. PLEASE FIX.
360 has locked up my tablet. All I get is Crash Report 360 Security Stopped. Once I get it removed will not use
This is dumb I opened up instagram and a website opened up telling me that a virus was attacking my phone and that I need to download your app. One star because of the blackmailing or whatever.
