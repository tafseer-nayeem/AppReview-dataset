Won't open I downloaded the app and it won't open at all. I unistalled it several times and it won't work. 
Why all the permissions for Why would a child's app need thus much permission It was a mistake to install.
Poor User Experience The game is aimed for a young audience and yet, the interaction is almost a mystery. The games or animations available are not developed well or fun. This will give kids a few minutes to work out what there is to do in the app before giving up. The game is large for what it offers, dev needs to optimise the installation, but that's the least of its issues.
Toto tree house This game is so cute
