Not worth buying. .. Its on a very short video loop...  This app should be free due to it being very basic. ..
Terrible audio The hissing sound is unbearable. I'm not even going to mention the fish appearing and disappearing when the video loops every minute or so. App like this should have been free. If you're gonna charge money then you have to do better. Would not buy another app from this developer.
This app does not work Do not buy it....
Works one out of five tries Terrible reliability issues startingloading data to chromecast. Nice once uploaded, but a huge waste of time trying to get it to upload
Doesn't work Sits loading forever. Rubbish.
Too unreliable. Works about one in 5 tries
Stuck loading screen Was really looking forward to this but looks like I'll be refunding it as it stays stuck in loading screen, tried several times, both aquariums to no avail.
Can't feed the fish  Great app nice and relaxing but some more features would make this a lot better such as feeding the fish option and more aquarium choices
poor quality waste of money. the tank is dirty it's just discusting
Good quality but short. It appears to only be about 30 seconds of video that loops. Not worth the money.
Its not working with me , loading then nothing , bad app
Just two aquariums... I dont recommend. Just two aquariums...
