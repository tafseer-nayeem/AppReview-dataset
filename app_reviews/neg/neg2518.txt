Froze Been doing good through the regular season, once I tried a cup, froze, that's it, Cup over. The time kept going and going, dude was stuck in one spot running around like a crackhead in a box. Had to quit game, so it was a 03 forfeit, can't win a cup with that. What's the point of accumulating points of you can't level up your guys anymore
Tackling Ther iz the problem of tackling and thr iz no new teams and statidem to and thr iz no skills perfomence n new features.....the game iz good but it should be excellent
I would rate it ZERO stars if possible.... Tackling is the problem of this game n there are no new teams, leagues .... Graphics are very bad..... Really bad Game.... Plz improve this game
WORST. GAME. EVER. It is retarded and has no clue how physics works. Do they even know that you can pass the ball on the ground  Waste of time and space.
CRAP It really is boring... No control over the goalkeeper, no sprint option and free kicks are taken facing your own goal for some strange reason... Uninstalled this garbage
Glitches opponents Very fast players but in works cup on 90 mins my opponents starts glitching and when I tackled him it goes normal and glitches again and I need to stop it giving them 30 wat the flip stupid app
Not good.. Actually its kinda off boring at the starting only. Controls are not that good. There is only sliding tackle plus there no stamina in the players to run faster for a longer time......
