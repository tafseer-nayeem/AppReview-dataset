Poor service I purchased the 1 year subscription and it didn't work. It kept asking me to purchase it again. I sent an email to customer service and they auto replied stating that someone would contact me in 48hrs. That was 3 months ago. Now I have paid 98 for nothing. Too badit was a good app.
Why can't you leave it the way it was too much crap not a good update.
Price Cost way Too much
