Game is good, buying coins is bad. I bought the game, now in order to unlock free build mode I need to pay more to get coins Wow
Pay to win When I got this game I was in in that the initial payment was it, but I was proven wrong so fast. If you even want a chance at winning levels later in the game, you either have to buy the unlimited resource mode, by the blueprint, or both, you guys the devs should be grateful that I'm giving you two stars. Believe me, if there was a zero star option, I would use it.
Bridge constructer Wouldn't let me pass on to the second level. Tried clicking the back to world button, nothing happened.
Crash rate every level Crashes every time u try to build a bridge, n u have to pay to get access to unlimited budget for building. Terrible.
Don't make people pay for hints in a paid app They are trying to make you pay for everything and it's a paid app. Be good people and try to design the best game possible instead of designing a game to make as much money possible.

Problem I bought it and know it wont download have pleanty of space and internet speed but it will not download waste of time and money
No option to disable audio ... ... Only music. No sync across devices
