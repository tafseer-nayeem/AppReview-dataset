Doesn't even let me log in I bought this app based on great reviews, but it didn't work. I've since read more reviews and can see it doesn't work on samsung s5. Very disappointing this wasn't stated in the description.
Doesn't sync ical to Samsung Galaxy S5 Waste of money and time.  Does not push my ical to my google calendar which is why I paid for the app.
Problem It won't accept my Apple User ID and password, which I have checked and both are correct.
Doesn't work with Galaxy 5 Can't believe i paid for an app that doesnt work. In some circles this would be considered fraud.
Nice Just bought the note 4 and it will not auto sync. Settings are correct,  but still not working. And the service here are super slow. I can't recommend it anymore...
1.8.9  sync fails  SSL issue Used to work fine, but no longer does due to it not being able to validate the cert..
Doesn't sync Used to work. Does not sync anymore. Keeps asking password. Android 5.0.2
