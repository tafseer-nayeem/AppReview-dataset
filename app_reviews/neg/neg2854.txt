The creepy laughing children, the buttons that go grey, the creepy carnival music.... I pretty sure this app is haunted.
Fun features but sound is terrible This is the most annoying sounding game I have ever heard.  I was thinking the touch tones were going to sound more like a phone, but the are just a major scale which would be fine if children weren't singing la la la la la la la la la la on the same two notes repeatedly, and don't even get me started on the song.  The sound of this game is not worth the fun but mundane features.  It does LOOK good, but that is it.
Creepy This app is all around creepy from the creepy music to the creepy child laughing my daughter hated this app and I just found it completely creepy I do not recommend  this to anyone o and the adds are terrible
Ads in a baby game Games that put clickable ads in the play area should be required to tell you that before download, completely useless for my 2yo...
What a croc Would give 0 stars if I could ad pops up and only way to close the added to close the app how can I make a relapse and don't make one at all
Great idea. Hate the ads My son loves this app, but he ends up hitting the ads a lot and it gets frustrating for both of us.
Bad Ad Placement Are u kidding me with the ad placement on a baby app Spend more time closing ads than actual playtime. Consider who the game is for. Uninstalling
Parents with smart babies beware I find this app very frustrating, my 10 month old daughter can get out of it quicker than I can. I also don't like the fact there's advertisements streaming above the game that she can touch that will take her away from the app with no trouble.
