Please help me Please can I get my witch of storm aria.. I been playing for years now and im the only one without That particular character I feel Unfair,at Disadvantages. .I cant get her no matter what. I feel unlucky that I m the only one in game I didn't receive her when I had first started playing the game for beginners .  I only got a 3 star Diana as starter gift which is a common hero on game. I got 2030 Diana just by combining, Summonings already.
So so game. Graphics are all right. The game play is basic. You only fight two groups of enemies before the round is over. And I also only received a 4 star for my initial sign up instead of a 5 star like the game said.
I can't update it It is always stopping at 124 i redownload it but it still stop and keep of retrying.
Early impressions are promising but minus three stars for putting me against an easy first time PvP against a team twice my level in the tutorial
