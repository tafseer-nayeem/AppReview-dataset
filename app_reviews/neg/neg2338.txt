I HATE IT play more games Ughhhhhhhhhh enough of old school get your gaming on kids
Dodo Becky's daughter said this game is a piece of doodoo
Awful. Doesn't sound like a piano at all. Really bad sound. I have heard a REAL piano before and it sounds nothing like this. Don't waste your time with this app.
Terrible When using it with more than one finger, the sound is terrible and makes daft clinking noises, not like a piano. Also when I quit out of the program, it stayed in landscape mode on my phone until I came back to the main menu on my phone. Major fail. Uninstalling straight away. Don't waste your time
Virtual piano This app has too many bugs. I would not reccomend this app
Sucks All I wanna do is play legend of Zelda music but no it makes rafting noises with more than in finger
Not good at all Almost all the keys don't work the piano this sounds nothing like a piano
I hate this piano I tried to make my own song but the voice was so bad. Don't install
Don't download this it is because this app dosn't actually like real piano... Some people say that this is good ,but that's not good.
It's ok. But can be better. You can't multi touch to make cool sounds sooo. Yeah What I said
