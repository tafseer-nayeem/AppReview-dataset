It won't even download. My kids are very upset and disappointed. It says insufficient storage space even though I have 64 GB of space.
It force closes on start up Every time I start the game it automatically force closes on me. What is the point of buying a video game that doesn't work For a Sprint Samsung Galaxy smartphone.
Not able to install I purchased the app but not able to install download. it says, not able to install due to error 923.  When trying for refund, mention that can not refund at this time, try later.
Battery drained fast Had been holding on to iphone because it used to be available for ios. didnt see anything difference except battery. For 1 level, 3 of the battery gone  .
IT SO STUPID It's nothing like any other Lego video game. It has bad controls, bad graphics, and if you expected it to be like LEGO Star Wars the Complete Saga, you are wrong. I want a refund on this app.
