Lost My City The game is OK but only being able to upgrade one building at a time has become boring. I found that it is hard to proceed as people no longer playing have city's on there and to attack is waste of time. I don't seem to get close to 10k I need. Also so many players can afford to buy big troops with gold. The only good thing is there is free gold for a certain time.I did contact but they only replied saying I would hear from them but they did not.
Crosses a line Top tier troops can only be obtained  by spending goldcash or random item drops.  If I had been more observant would've dropped this game sooner than I did and not spent any money here.

Game won't run I am assuming there are special firewall ports that need to be opened because the game won't run and is stuck at 0 checking when launched  sent report
Tutorial The tutorial is to fing long. I feel like that it thinks I don't know how to play. Add a skip button and the game will be much better
You get muted for no reason, depends on how the mod is feeling today. Mods are biased towards their alliances and friends
Cheats, hackers,  or developers I've been playing this game for almost 2 years,  then two cities who mysteriously buy 12 to 15 150 chests a day for months.  The math doesn't add up.  FT denies any cheating,  then they have rss that are never ending.  It's total garbage.  We dominate the game straight up,  then the devs need to interfere because we beat them at their own game.  What a joke.  The least they could do is refund everyone who bought gold the right way.
