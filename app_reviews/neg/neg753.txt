Less themes and better autocorrect a i used to be such a great option, now have the worst auto correct. Overdoing the put your picture on the keyboard. This a keyboard not a photo album Edit  What a condescending replayi I aproached you in ENGLISH but aitype keyboard messed up my typing
A very good keyboard but for the obscenities  I upped my rating, but then found it offers obscenities for substitute words which is plain OFF.  Needs fixing.   If I could have at 0 stars I would. Developers dont seem interested.   Wanted more than SwiftKey has. Liked the extra symbols for my work.  The keyboard has seen some big improvements and predictions have continued to improve.  Keep up the good work.
Back to being disappointing repeated updates that don't fix things  frustration What's with the Swipe suddenly choosing not to work all of a sudden I've been trying to work with the unforgiving swipe accuracy, but it's getting tedious now. And the prediction couldn't be more annoying at times.
Love this app but every since the update I can't use the emojis. It always says keyboard has stopped
