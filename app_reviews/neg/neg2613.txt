Horrible I bought full version DP2 first. Finished and waiting for coming soon. Just bought DP1, nothing like 2. Everything wrong in DP1 they have corrected in part 2. Which is 5 stars all the way Dont waste time on this one, aiming and release is completely different, reversed in every direction.  Dissapointed really
Not worth it, no horse. FIX LEVEL EDITOR. Bought an in app purchase and never worked. Tried to contact the developers by email but they never responded. Edit got the app purchase but took awhile Awhile not just a week, game gets boring after you win. In the screenshots it said their is horse. Yet I can not find the game mode. Edit two  level editor is so buggy. You can not rotate the objects and the view needs zoom out and in so you can make the levels bigger.
Thank you for fixing it so it will work on my phone Its a pretty good game but i absolutely hate the scoring on it
