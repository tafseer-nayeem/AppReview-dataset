Big issues Isn't letting me log into my dgcr account from app. Using correct name and password. Keeps saying it is invalid. Not worth 5 bucks. Already uninstalled and getting my refund
HELP Could not purchase this app. Google Play kept giving me the message that payment was declined. Tried Paypal, Credit Card and ATT billing. Nothing worked. Could not get it to download to my LG phone. I got a message from ATT thanking me for purchasing it and it STILL would not download. Now, in Google Play, it does not show INSTALLED. It just shows 4.99 in the green box. Frustrating
