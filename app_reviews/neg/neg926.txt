Broken on Nexus 6P Just displays a geocaching is dangerous popup with no way to close so can't move past it. Shame, as would love to buy the full version 
Broken on Nexus 5X The app shows a dialog that says Geocaching can be dangerous. There is no way to accept or continue. Even stopping the app and starting from scratch only gets to the same place. Hope it is fixed soon.
No field note capability, no support for trackables or pocket queries. Really no comparison to the old paid app.
This is poor given the price of membership The app should allow you to remember caches in a given area in case there is no network signal which often happens.  Also, why have a paid app where all the comments are get the free app it is better.  Features like trackables are just fluff.  You should get the basics down given the ridiculously high membership fee.
Messages always on  Nice geocaching app for beginners. Unfortunately, once you are logged in, the Messenger can neither be silenced nor disabled. It's always on, uses battery power and beeps if you like it or not. Good intentions but please let the user configure if he wants to be always on and if so then how he wants to get notified.
Does not install on moto g Didn't run after installation
Lies This app tells lies bout what is a premium cache and what is not. Having compared our local caches it seems that it just wants you to pay to upgraded. Very dishonest groundspeak
30 subscription My iPhone using friend was really talking up the fun of geocaching, so I went to buy the Android version.  Turns out the 10 I thought was already expensive for a crowd sourced map is now a 30 subscription and the 10 app is abandoned  Way to exclude the majority of your potential user base before they even get started.
