Greedy support team Support team is basically a group of greedy techs. I changed my phone and asked them to transfer my credits so I won't have to pay for the app again like the way it is in 99 of other apps and the team told me to buy it again for the new device. It is standard for paid apps to be transferred to the new phones. I had 7 other paid apps and all 7 of them were transferred because the support team was willing to help.
