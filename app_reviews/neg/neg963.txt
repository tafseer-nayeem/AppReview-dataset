IT DOES NOT WORK This app worked one time.  Then it didn't.  It hasn't even tried to sync for 2 months and only with 2 pairs and both errored out.  Wrote Dev.  Was basically told that it should work fine and that was about it.
Very difficult to setup.  Help section is unclear.  Unable to pair folders according to the cryptic directions provided.  Frustrating.
I cannot open a SMB share. I can open it on every computer and I can open it using Total Commander on Android. I cannot open it using this app. I really want to like this app, but it is too inconsistent for me.
This app has problems syncing medium  large files to network samba shares. Even small videos made on my cell phone cannot be synced.  I have Sent detailed debugging info and log files to developer but never got a reply or bug fix 
Not working at all. Sync in progress... but no data transfered at all.
Was working Not sure what happened, but now it gets an error every time it syncs. Would love it if it would start working again. Error is very vague.
