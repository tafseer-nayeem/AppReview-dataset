It lost 6 months of my data after I paid for cloud storage Used to love this app. I PAID for it so my data would always be safe. Last week I tried to backup to cloud like I always do after filling up, but for 2 days it said it couldn't backup. Had to wipe my phone today, but when I restored from cloud, IT HAD LOST 6 MONTHS OF DATA. Now I have no record of gas expenses for work and I fill my tank 3 times a week due to my delivery job. I'm FURIOUS
Was good Worked great, then one day it stopped. I used it after the most recent updates. 3 days after last use, I get a license error. The prompt tells me to purchase the product and redirects to the Play store. I own a license. Still no response from the developer. 1127  no response from the dv, reported to Google, removed useless app. 25no response yet
Not Working right Does not backup the information as promised useless if every update yo need to star all over.
Nice app for car owners. IF ONLY THE ONLINE BACKUP WORKS Been using xls to manage and view my car's expenses and this app does that and more. I'd give it more if it fixes the online backup tool and if it backs up in Google, not Carango's.
Please add pictures support It would be more useful if users could add pictures. For example of the insurance paper, or the registration card. Even the picture of the spare parts changed, to remember the brand in future. Also pictures of garage receipts. I'm looking for another app with these features.
