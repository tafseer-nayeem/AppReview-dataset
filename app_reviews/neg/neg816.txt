The camera doesn't want to open
Hate it now Since the update it keeps on freezing and then stops altogether I realise its the sign of the times but if it ain.t broke DON.T FIX IT Because now it's absolutely useless.Whereas before it was a great app Now it does not work at all.
Wtf...every time i open the app it terminates itself Please improve the update...very disappointed
Crashes while trying to save on my Android one device Features are nice but I can't save any pic after edit
Having fun I can't use any photo frames anymore don't like the new updates uninstalling from my phone
Waste app Such a stupid app effects are not working .waste app
Wtf In general mode photos which are clicked are blur do something for it. Plz and then it will be five star app for me.
