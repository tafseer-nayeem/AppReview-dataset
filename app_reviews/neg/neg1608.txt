Bad scanning and way too many text abbreviations. It really ruins the story when the scans I'm reading are fine for a while, and then along come a chapter that has barely visible yellow pages and text language. It's especially annoying when it happens repeatedly.
What Whenever I touch ANYTHING,  thr whole app crashes,  not to mention right before it gives me a JSON parsing error Please fix because so far,  your app sucks.
Not working When app is open nothing pops up. Gives out an error code and then states not working and closes. Before I loved the app. I'm not sure what happened
Disappointing Plenty of choices but what's the point if the chapters aren't updated. Needs a lot of work. I would choose a manga and I would give me another instead, and if I select a favorite I can't even unselect it and it stays there. Needs to be more convenient
It was great up until now, ads are popping up a lot more frequently than before.  Every single page an ad pops up now, and before it was about every chapter
I would rate it higher if you could save where you left off. I'd recommend Mangazone instead because you can download the Mangas for offline use so you don't have to use your data and it tells you the last chapter and page you were on.
TOO LATE LOADING It took so much time to just load the home page...I'll spent too much time and too much battery for it...Please make the loading faster..Oh and it always stop when I'm reading my fav manga...ltlt
