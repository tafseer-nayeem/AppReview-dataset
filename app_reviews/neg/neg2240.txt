Boring
Just eh
Double with any bar combination does not pay Been broken like this for years.   Why don't you fix it     Any bar combination with double diamond pays nothing... Zero
To strars Two first, if more must b very GG 
Winnings not always registering Diamond symbol with mixed bars NOT awarding....single bar, double bar, diamond or double bar, triple bar, diamond symbol for example ... Why hasn't someone responded.   Sent message to support.   If it is not recording a win correctly, then why have it at all.   Would like to have apps that work correctly
Go make coffee while waiting to collect winnings Downloaded the game, first spin I hit jackpot and have to wait nearly 2 minutes to collect my winnings. Second spin, another big win, another long wait. Sorry, not for me  uninstalled.
Zero credits Can't spin, says I have 0 credits when, in fact, I have  7,157,999,782,892,612,286  credits showing.  What's the problem Think anyone can fix it Think anyone even cares or reads what the players have to say about the game They are in the business to make money, if you don't buy credits, they don't want your business.    Oh, and if you tap the black area next to the spin button,  boom, your points are all there. No need to wait.
