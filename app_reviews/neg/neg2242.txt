After update was kicked back to level 1 and my 20000 credits are gone. WHY....... and you ask to be rated. You're lucky I gave you a 2. I WANT my level and credits back...
Crappy game I have had this game on my tablet for a long time have bought a lot of coins I had to reload since then it doesn't pay when I win large it also locks up after about 1015 rolls I can't find a way to contact the company the address listed in the app goes nowhere so be careful and don't buy anything from them I've lost several million points also on the old app I got to a billion then it took it away and made me start over Clifford A Rowell
NOT HAPPY Would play multi x's a day... On level 97 next time I play now level 1. Still have level 97 VIP points and my win trophies...  SO I WANT MY LEVEL 97 BACK  Went from like 10,000.00 level up bonus down to 50.00. I played my butt off to get to that level.
started out as a good game with good payouts but as time has gone on it seems to pay less and less even less when you pay for credits. Wouldn't recommend it unless you're willing to pay sometimes for nothing.
old vegas thanks for the latesst update. I enjoyed the game on my tablet, and when I updated a short time ago I can't play it on my tablet. how do I get it back
I had 1,139,000 points and went to play the next day and they were all gone.They srarted me as a new player with 2000 points.Can't get a hold of anyone to correct it.Spent plenty playing this. BEWARE
