Not so updated I love the UI, it's beautiful. Really. However it took quite long time for Talon to provide new Twitter features I'm still waiting for poll feature. And now the Activity tabs is typically the same mention because there are no more favs or RTs shown
Lazy developer Fix partial dates already come on.....
Not great Search is better than the official app but won't open profiles when switching from chrome search to the app and annoyingly loses place on timeline when switching from portrait to landscape and closing photos. The app is far too complex for its own good.
Chewed thru my data Upon the last update my sync settings changed. Not happy. My sync settings were set to wifi only. To my surprise, I went thru 4 gigs of data on mobile. Love the app but that sucks now I'm looking at overage charges
Asked me to rate it Otherwise very good.
