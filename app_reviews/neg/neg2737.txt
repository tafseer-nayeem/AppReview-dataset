You never win Like the computer always wins I will give it a better rait if u fix that
I love it It is soooooo fun to play late at night because really good people play at night and it gets really challenging. Also a good game for a long car ride
Glitchy Not what I expected at all I normally like cartoon network that's why I downloaded it but wasn't good at all
Hated it HATED I payed for a fun game  not this
Doesn't work I have just recently bought this game then I opened it up but the wheel keep spining for 10min and it doesn't work please fix this or I'll refund .
