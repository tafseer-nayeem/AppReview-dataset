Pushes memes, not news. Needs user controls to be useful. The underlying app is excellent, it's just applied to the wrong content.
Trying to read news Nothing but popups to sell something. Can't even get to some storys
Nice interface Extremely limited in what categories can be added though. Very disappointing and underwhelming
