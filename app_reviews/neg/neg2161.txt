Disappointed 30 email missions is misleading for 5 that number should be higher in my opinion especially for the good money I gave you. definitely will not give you more  for something that should have come with the original package. good for you and your success but at some point give back to the people. Im Not going to suggest this to anyone till you give away at least a set of colors or something to make it worth while. Thanks for the day waste.
Waste of money Upgraded yet had 1355  yet 9nce paid for the full version I lost that  and had to start again with no paint or brushes...will be reporting this to the ACCC as Im tired of paying for apps and getting ripped off by freaks
Disapoitment I thought paying 5 for an app would actually unlock all of the features. How about dropping the price if you're not going to include everything, and make us pay even more for extras that should've been included. Waste of money in my opinion.
still crashing I want a refund Can't even play it crashes instantly..... galaxy s5
Disappointed I purchased the game and had lots of colors and e everything mostly. Changed phone and re downloaded the game and it still show purchased but lost everything I bought. Including all the designs colors projects all that work I did. Now it is back to the beginning. I would like my money back
Misleading Scandalousness Thank you for taking a great idea and putting it in the hands of scumbags.  My 8 year old just learned a valuable lesson.  It is better to rid yourself of something that is giving you constant unnecessary disappointment, even if it's something you really like.  She loved it, and after 2 days, wants it uninstalled immediately.
