Rotten after latest update Dear u added the catenary but the railway line is blurred earlier version it was ok. And pls make changes.Its same in all 3tiers no challenges. U correct 1mistake and commit another blunder.Line is not properly illuminated. Loco overhead light dimly lit, flickering. U messed it all up. All good work down the drain. Sucks.Lost all interest in playing after seeing the poor graphics after updating. All charm gone.
Waste Graphics are not good I can't able to play happily
