Too many adds I used to love this game but it has become too much. Pop ups that you don't even know you are clicking on. Videos you can't exit. NOT WORTH IT.
Won't work I used to have a tablet and it worked. Then it stopped working then I got a s2 from my sister. Then I got my apps on it and I put this on it and I crashes before the level screen
Wast worst game ever I can't play  the  game  if I  click  the play button  it goes to play storeso please don't  install  the  app  if you  have  Uninstall the  app.
Giving one star because there is no negative mark to give Hated it. Its not worth 4.3
On until end of viedo I love it but at the end of the video it always kicks me out I mean seriously is the a movie  trailer or what
Cut the rope A slow and time wasting game.full of time consuming pop ups.one of the worst games ever played by man kind 
this app is not getting launched in my digiflip pro xt911 tab at all. I even forwarded error report also. I tried repeatedly with same result. I even uninstalled  then freshly downloaded from play store  installed the app almost 4 times with same result.
It won't even let me play ..fix this and I'll give it five star's
Why so many Advertisement It was Good and Fun. But with new update it becomes a advertising app. Some levels required candy which can only be collected by viewing advertisement. It is too embarrassing.
Candy lives Just an all around terrible mechanic. Would have played and watched ads if not for that.
Obsessed with selling I have no problem paying for a good app but this one which used to be really good is purely about extracting additional charges from you. And SO many ads.
In game charges  loads of ads I'd have been happy to pay a one off charge for this but the ads, limited play  charges lost my interest. Pure greed.
doesnt work when i open it it just freez plz fix that
Ads  Awesome game but requires candies to play every level  hate the ads pop up
