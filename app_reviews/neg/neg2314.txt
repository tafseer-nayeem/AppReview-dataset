Useless app This is a completely useless app. The developer clearly does not know anything about Tabla. The app just makes random noises similar to Tabla on any side. The developer should at least have made an attempt to understand how to play the Tabla, how it looks, which is bass drum and pitch drum, among other basic things. Totally useless app.
Poor sound n developer doesn't know anything about this instrument This app is total wastage of time poor quality sound. This is not 1 close to musical instrument tabla I think developer doesn't know  what tabla actually is... So don't waste your time
Nothing like tabla The sounds are not in the right place and many are missing.  The left drum should be bass only and the right harmonic tones and percussive slaps.  It is equivalent to hitting a snare drum and getting a cymbal sound out of it. Wrong, useless, and nothing like real set of tabla at all.
Not good The person who developed it dont know anything about tabla
Not good I want to give 1.5 stars. Sounds are realistic but It can't give the fun of real tabla playing
Not as expected Not simulating a real tabla...looks like some wave files have been imported and then played back backed on where the user selects the screen...not worth installing
Not Bad This app doesn't have option to play other music
