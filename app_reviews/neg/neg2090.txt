Very calming to do. I like the pieces on the side instead all over the place. But I' my starting to loose my puzzles. I will save as a I go but when I get back it's gone. Please fix. A lot of work goes into these puzzles  and it's starting to get frustrating.
Keep working on the bug, I can almost purchase new puzzles and get my previous purchased packs.  Once I can you can get 5 stars,
Two attempts, two crashes Just started playing this. Five minutes into the first puzzle, screen goes blank and progress is lost. At the second attempt I got ten minutes in when the same thing happened. Total waste of time  deleted.
