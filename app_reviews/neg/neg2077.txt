Bought this because of its reviews and am left disappointed. Dull graphics, incredibly repetitive and no real replay value. Only plus is that it needs no permissions and is easy on the battery
Doesn't deserve 4 stars I was suckered into buying just to try, and it's disappointing. It's like candy crush for dudes or something. It's only saving grace is no permissions. Save your money.
Not worth playing Blocky pixels moving to other Blocky pixels,  it's easier to keep swiping screen than to try to get it right
Dreadful waste of 2 pounds Frustratingly difficult. Most of the time the game simply doesn't provide you with the tools you need to defeat the current enemy, and tiles are mostly scattered uselessly across the board.  Not that much fun.
WiNoJoE sez Not really sure why I bought this app, as I didn't like their 1st one either. Got suckered in by all the glowing reviews I guess. Uninstalled after playing a few levels, maybe I just don't get it, but now sorry I wasted my  again . Lousy graphics should have been enough to warn me away.
Fun game, dumb quests Been stuck on the quest that requires 10 blocks destroyed from a bomb. Ran it 30 times so far, had 11 bombs, all did 47 blocks. Can't progress. At least let us count multiple bombs with that amount A dumb and poorly tested roadblock.
Won't load I sent an email to the company about it never loading and I still haven't received a response. I loved their previous game and I like to try this one
No cloud saves While I did enjoy the game, not having some kind of cloud savebackup just ruins it when you move devices, get a new device, have to wipe a device...
Won't install on note 4 Can't get it to install. Other apps install fine. Just keeps trying to download it after it is already downloaded...
