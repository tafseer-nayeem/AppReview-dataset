Wow
To play a song it redirects you to a different site and you have to sit thru ads and commercials before the song starts.  Horrible for kids.
it's irritating... i've tried to play it and it says there is no network available though i'm using wifi... if only i could give zero, i would...
Looks good But dose not work
