Call of Duty Heroes Since the Update it SUCKS Why can't you fix it it's beginning to not be fun and if it isn't fun then why should we keep trying to play the game  
Update Problem Seriously was one of my favorite games. But with the latest 2 update I can no longer play it. It keeps saying something about my user name before the screen it is even done loading. I waited for another update, which it did,  but the same problem persist. I'll just be deleting this app.
add game content in play store only so that it would be.. easy to download If i get any calls the download of game content wl start frm 0
Next to no effort was put into this game The cod waw zombie mobile game has better graphics
Doesn't finish loading Can't play this game as the loading bar doesn't fully fill up Will give higher rating when I get to play it
It's weird To sistem how do they count the league points it's weird, it's a morning that I'm playing, scoring sixteen point each time but even if I need only twelve, eight, six, now three, point I can't achieve the next league, this is weird, seems that they want that you play the whole day...this is not properly fair, I'll wait again two or three matches, if the score sistem it will rest the same, I'll delete the game, it means that is not for me.
Problem Continues I uninstalled and reinstalled  the app but it still shows the loading bar and the percentage stays at 0 and than quickly says, internet connection is needed for this game application... I have internet. My phone is an LG Volt Android cell phone. Thank you for the feed but I still have the same problem
