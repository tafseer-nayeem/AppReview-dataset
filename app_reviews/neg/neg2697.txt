Nick Bisello I cannot input Ft and inches as one unit as per the description photos above. If this feature was added as per the photo above, I would rate the app 55.
Needs more units. You need to add a lot of units to Diferenciate this app from the free one because right now there are not a lot of differences between them.
You have to be kidding me I cannot compare few currencies by my choice  That is  ridiculous limitation for such an app.
Unit t Converter plus This app is poor. For example the only currency conversation rate available is from the selected currency to USD. It's not possible to go straight from EUR to GBP. It's useless.
Flow conversions lacking Not enough conversions.  I don't find any way to add industry specific units.
