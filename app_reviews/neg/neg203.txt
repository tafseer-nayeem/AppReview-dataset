No good I posted something it said in my notifications that I had a comment but when I clicked on it I could not see any climate and when I clicked on the app checking it that way still could not find any comments and also when I downloaded it it was supposed to give me 69 coins for my Walking Dead survival game they lied they never gave them to me I even did the update through walking dead and still no coins
Terrible website, d8es not me me load my items for sale. Not one calks tried other sires and got a lot more calls. Book
App has no organization... too much stuff I am not interested  in that I have to pick over... need to org. like craigslist  no location given for items listed pictures seem all jumbled together  make all pictures same size and show only one item at a time
I don't know...not my style
What The F I already have someone being sexist at me, wrongfully if I might add. And....there's no way to block anyone. Wth. Surely an eBay affiliated app would be better than this.
