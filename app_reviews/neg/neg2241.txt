App no longer loads I actually really liked this app, but then it started freezing during tournaments with the reels endlessly spinning. I still played anyway and endured the freezes. But now the app won't even load at all, although I can hear it running in the background the music. So annoying. It would be great if it actually worked.
Pays are nonexistent.  Reloading game takes forever and games are very sporadiac until level 8 and by then money is gone due to no pays and have to start downloading all over.  Just about done with this aggravation
Lucky casino Join game please stop freezing
How does someones reels continuously  spin on every game they play  
Almost every time I get a good hand it freezes and I lose chips. Y'all need to fix it or I'm deleting.
I bought 2,000,000 credits Nov.24 payment was successful, but only 500  credits was loaded., wrong info for clients. Do not buy coins , you will not get what you pay for.

Lucky win casino Keeps saying my internet is not working.  It works for everything else.  Why have a game that you cannot play
Can't win Only time it ask for a rate is after a win...and the win is after it takes all of your money. ...don't waste your time. Unless you like to play for 5 mins
Was a great game before update I installed the new update and now. I can't even open the game it keeps on telling me to install up date  it was a good game before this updates  can't no longer play

I updated per instructions and like every other review, it KEEPS telling me to update and won't let me play. You should probably check up on the MASSIVE bug that apparently is keeping everyone from using your app The good news...literally hundreds of slot apps at the playstore keep you occupied...Please fix this problem or you're going to experience a massive uninstall by tons of unhappy trying to be players.
Not allowed to access the game unless I logged in.  I wanted to play as guest but want me information.  I am now unstalling this game is wasting my time
What happened After update it doesn't let me logon it keeps saying needs new update..I uninstalled and installed 3 times and it keeps saying needs new update.. Please fix asap..
Still not working after upgrade Despite you earlier updates it is still not working since upgrade, saying it needs upgrade still. Have uninstalled and reinstalled twice too but error message still saying the same thing
Lied about free credits When you are offered 1,000 000 credits to change your playing status from guest to logging in on Facebook. .. don't expect to get anything  It doesn't happen
