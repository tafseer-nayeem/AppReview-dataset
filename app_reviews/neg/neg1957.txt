Wtf This is one of the dummest games i have ever seen.. no controls just some hopping betwen cameras and random spooking and game makes no sense at all Whats the hype about
Bull Night 1 I just suckits not the problem. night 2 spring trap is at my door by thy time I can reboot 1 system. P.s in game 1 you are supposed to loose power 24.7
Amazing The game is real fun and there is one thing about it that I don't get and that is that when spring trap is at cam 7 the puppet mask moves from the closet right at the spot where the cams are and the people ask how he gets to ur office so quick when he is at cam 10 is because he takes the vents so try to keep him on cam 7 so use the audio device
Dislike it It won't let me move at all when you begin the game.... 2 stars.... not the best app at all
