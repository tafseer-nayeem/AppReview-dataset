No setup  unprofessional Despite assurances many times. They delivered wrong medicines. Pathetic service. Send review and email to some Meet Shah but no response. Avoid....
NO RETURN POLICY I have purchased medicine worth Rs.2000 for my father. SUDDENLY MY FATHER Expired so  I called up pharm easy for return of the unused sealed  packed medicines but they roughly said No, we wont take backed the medicine.
Horrible Keeps rejecting orders. Pathetic. Waste of time.
Services They don't replace wrong medicine delivered when we are giving prescription why the don't see and some time they don't deliver full medicine
Dont at all get this app its really bad.u wont get ur medicines prescribed.by ur local dr.
Look in to this... Why do you want to read our contacts  Picking up prescription image from gallery is a tedious job Make proper classifications for ease Moreover add a medicine chart to know which medicine matches the prescription  from which retailer are we going to get it
Local retailers are taking undue benefits of loopholes in the app and also delivery is never in time. Lot of improvement is required.
Dhirajlal shah No exchange policy though we have the bill. As doctor have change the medicines because of medical complication
Very Pathetic service. I didnt receive my order even after 3 days and they say 1 hour. Guys gear up. Pathetic interface of the app. You so depress me
