ADS There are random times it's stops and loads and brings you to the very top off your feed and you have to restart not to mention the ads that are 30 seconds long every 5 wishbones
Good app, BUT REALLY ANNOYING I enjoy voting on this app, I think that it is fun that you can make your own wishbones. But, SOOOO many adds, they are 30 seconds long and come every 5 wishbones.  To make matters worse, 75 of the time, after the add, wishbone restarts and I have to start from the top of the feed. I don't loose my progress but once I scroll down to get back to where I was, which takes FOREVER another add comes up in the process and restarts wishbone.  SO FRUSTERATING
Hate it I go to rate and every five seconds there's a stupid add and on top of that it's so slow even when the WiFi is working perfectly and when u go to turn my phone off and start the app again it starts from the top
TO MANY ADS I would not download the app it sucks has to many adds and it takes up my battery I hate it it takes to long to load and I suggest that you don't download it
Cool, to many ads Love the app, its perfect for when I'm bored. But there are so many adds it can be hard to use the app
Invalid request I try logging in but it says invalid request so I try to log in with my phone number. It says please enter a valid country code and phone number.  when I put in my correct phone number. It was fun when it worked.
Way to many ads The app is ok but the omly problem is that every time that i want to go to tbe card that i was on it kept on putting afs every 30 seconds please fix it
My problem is the username I can't put a in a username its always telling me how it has to be at least three letters and they have to be numbers it has to be all lowercase who wants that clearly no one if you want a good username sorry but you game is not here
