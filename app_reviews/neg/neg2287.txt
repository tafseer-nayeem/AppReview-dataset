Not bad
The hand numbers are wrong when they count to three the way the put the hand is as a six not a three. I grew up wit a deaf mom and my daughter is learning how to sign . No learning number games have the right hand gesture for the number three... Very disappointed. And they do not say Z they say Zed .... If we want to learn German will take a class. But i want my child to learn properly on a LEARNING game.
