Not very informative Yes it goes over the basics that can be found in literally thousands of places online and other apps. User friendly but has a very limited list of items in its system. Only gives an answer for 50 of what I asked.
Major typosincomplete It's helpful at the most basic level is corn paleo  no. But if you dive into the supporting materials it's nearly unreadable with all the typos, botched cutpaste jobs, nonworking  hyperlinks, blank screens, paragraphs that end mid sentence, etc. Go with the free app.
C'Mon Guys Sheesh Good idea. Terribly incomplete info. I'd be happy to upgrade my rating once you complete the database for the crucial More Info pages. Not only does every veg I've looked up for example take me to the same page, it's full of typos and often contradictory. Thumbs down for potatoes for example but the page says in certain quantities. Well, what quantities The app is supposed to help us with these decisions. One per day One per week Just a tablespoon a day
I wish I had not paid for this. There are HUNDREDS of free resources out there that are more comprehensive. I thought this would give micro and macros etc. A hobo would've used my money more wisely........
Is it worth 3 dollars Not really This app doesn't do anything spectacular. Everything here you can find by searching for yourself. However, laziness abides in us all. Wish it had base values of calories, protein, and whatnot but its a list not a nutritional guide.
Very basic Includes basic list you can easily search the Internet for free
This app is junk Hangs up all the time. doesn't really work most of the time. offers very little value.
