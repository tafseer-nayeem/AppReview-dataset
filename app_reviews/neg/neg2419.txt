Ads This game is full of adds.hope it could have better graphics and more detailing if anyone dashes our car still our only missions fails
Adds any lag Always adds pop up after you failed your mission....
It would be nice if you gave us direction s on where to go
Wtf Its not fair that other cars can hit me when im waiting for cars to pass so i could turn, then i loose and have to start over. Its not fair and for that im uninstalling
Avoid like a plague 30 secs of ads followed by an invitation to play games.
IT KEEPS FREEZING WHEN I JUST STARTED THE GAME
Worst Don't ever get these game it keeps on kleching
Graphics is not good. Steering cannot be changed to right side
Needs improvement When we take turns the behind cars should stop on the spot i also hate all the ads 3rd mission is too difficult
I can't even start mission 1 it keeps freezing
Ads There are so many ads and gets annoying
Sucks This game sucks way too many ads omg
Hated it When you try to drive you had to buy a car I thought it would be wasn't worth  adds came up every 10 mins its not good don't get it 
Don't buy the worst game ever
