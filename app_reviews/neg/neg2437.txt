Seriously As a quest, you are asked to invite friends facebook and register at a social  site but if you choose not to a large graphic stays permenantly planted on your screen and it continually stays on your list of 'to do' quests. Not a smart move there developers.
I tried to get more gold. Did a survey for 4 things of gold and got to the last question and said I didn't  finish Try to  many ways but didn't work.
Disappointed I enjoy the game, however is nearly impossible to get the machetes unless you want to buy them, which you need to get anywhere in the game. I'm a cheapskate I don't buy anything for the games I play.
Expensive Item Why the item should be that expensive How can we enjoy playing this. And the machete is too expensive and hard to have.
If I could give 0 stars I would..I'm going on 2 months w no quests and it just updated and still nothing
Machete Like you need them for progress of the game. ..what's the point of gold ...I paid for machete once for the sake of progress went out on less than three hours waited 4 days to gain some more ...good game but uninstall
Things are proving for the better. Finally. Thank you very much.  for now, 2 stars, I'm sure more in the future
Glitching after update Worked better before I updated it.
