Calling still feels confusing. I wanted an app to make the actual phone call aspect of my phone feel more natural. I still have to click the number of the contact instead of a picture and then call icon to make a call and easily click number by mistake calling people by accident. I just want simple.
Very good app but hate losing privacy Reducing rating to 1 star coz of new feature wherein it indicates current status but I hate losing my privacy as I don't want people to know whether I'm online or not and there is no option to stop that indicator
Uninstalling What's d use of having truedialer when I m getting d same service as other app. I thought this app would show me d image of d caller or unknown caller BT it didn't, what's d point.Uninstalling
Problem I have my bro's number in contact list saved with his picture but in dialer it shows a strangers photo and in info Facebook link of that person. Up to link that was ok but his picture in place of my brother not cool. The app must give local information more preference than from true caller.
Worst ever true dailer Failure model. Please uninstall this and go for some good apps. Don't waste your time in this app. Really waste of time.
Want a call reminder  link with other social network. Still you are not provide a option of call reminder to someone  also want link with other social network like Facebook,Whatsapp  etc... why don't you merge your other two apps in this app. why don't  you make 3 in 1.
Call log restrictions only call log for last 5 days visible where as my default app has history for 3months
This aap is really useful V can find anybody's no. With the help if this
Expexted more Quite a disappointed. I thought this would change my phone calling experience but did not. Uninstalled.
Block doesn't work Some numbers aren't getting added to the block list from the true dialer app.
