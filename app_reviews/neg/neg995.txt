Ambient mode I like the face, but ambient mode is terrible. Personally, I would like ambient mode to just tell the time in an aesthetic way. Can't use it for now.

Kills the battery On moto 360,  kills my battery.  Normally the watch last 16 hours.  With this face I only get about 10 hours.
LG g3 It's really drained my battery fast. Request a refund. Thanks
Looks great, kills my battery waaaay too quickly. With a stock watch face my battery would last all day.  After 5 hours today I am down to 58  it won't make it a day.  Worthless if it kills your battery
Good lookinginformative but kills your battery It seemed good until I tried it from a full charge and it kills your battery way to fast. On the moto 360 a power hungry watch face is the last thing you need. Hopefully it can be optimized but I wish I could have found out to get a refund.
Battery Drainer Love the look.  Unfortunately draining battery in 3 hrs.  Will rate 5 stars once fixed.
Great watch face but huge battery hog Most watch faces run around 5hr on my 360, this one drains 10hr. I cannot afford to use this watch face since my watch dies so much faster. Dev has lots of great watch face designs that I would love to try out but not until the battery consumption on this one is improved drastically. Edit slightly better with the latest update but still running around 8hr which is still unacceptable.
