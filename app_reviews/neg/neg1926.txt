Buggy My point gets reset many times. I go back n start again to correct it. In such case the game touch sense gets lost. Even if game sometimes starts correctly, it stops and restarts with the bug. Even on update it is there. If i uninstall my levels wud b lost. No link for feedback within app.
REMOVE THE IRRITATING ADDS Game is full of adds. Unnecessary. Adds even pops up during the swinging of the monkey without legs. Not even one star worthy Those who like Benji Banana play on a Apple device Eventhough it lags on apple devices, there are no adds in the game
Greedy developers Swamped with ads. Used to be cool.
Why so many videos Its so annoying having to watch a video every cuple of games. Sometimes it seems to happen after every game. They already have a lot of options to watch a video for more bananas, extra life and to try levels for free. Not the same game i remember
PIECE OF CRAP Ads always appear when i will start a game i will uninstall this game  now
Ads Constant 30 second add vidioes aswell as banner ads
It was awesome fun...I was addicted to it but, now a lot of ad's hate it like hell
High ads Advertisements are too much. Very irritating
Always lag Damn those fcking ADS
