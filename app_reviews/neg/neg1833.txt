Bugs and no audio Loved this game on consoles so interested to see what it was like on mobile. Controls work well but I don't get any audio and randomly crashes. Using a Nexus 5X.
No achievements... I beat the game and realised I didn't get anything for it. If I'd been given them, this game would be 5 stars
