Too many ads. The music doesn't stop when you close the game and had to uninstall to get it to stop. Constant requests to rate the game. The balls are halfway through the board before you can start shooting. And there's no way to switch the ball color so you end shooting in space a lot wasting shots.
I loved the game But after a while it started to get a bit slower at times like it was struggling to load. . Then on one of the levels the balls wouldn't show on a 5mm1cm length of the chain when I tried to get more stars on that level after clocking the game. . And just now it glitched hard.. The balls just keep going round and round so I'm just going to delete it. . Thanks for the memories lol
Ranae Smith Didn't like it.  Can't shoot right away and it's impossible to get past level 7. I'm uninstalling.
Yipie can't wait for my leisure time  to play this game
No powers to help get to next level No power ups to help get to next level
No instructions  no way to turn off sound
I don't like it... I'd rather zumba blitz with frog .
Gay no good This game is not fun and weird..
Jungle marble I love it its fun
The is annoying. No fixed score to heat for the next level
No Help I can't figure it out.
Not Fun It's to hard to control, it sometimes shoots 23 balls out at once.
