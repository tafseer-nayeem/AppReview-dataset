I would love to play this game all the time if you guys could fix the glitches I very much appreciate it if you can't then you're not going to be able to make any money off this game everything people make several comments about the glitching and yet I have seen no effect as in you fixing it you could probably actually make a lot of money on this game if you would fix that one problem
Creative It is a really good game but you should be able to do multiplayer in survival not just creative if  you fix that then I'll give you 5 
Ugh This game was great until they put the ads right over the map and location info now I can't tell were I am.  Please move them or make them come and go. Thanks and once this is fixed I will give you a 5 star rating.
Hate it P My phone keeps having problems ever since I download this app I love this app cause I can play with family and friends but glitches all the time
Needs major work I like the concept so far, but the controls are too sloppy and there are a few glitches I have found.
