Suttering and pauses too long on full stop. Was excellent,  but latest update does not sound good. Samsung and google tts do not have these problems
Google Now and Maps Is there anyway to make this work with Google Now and Maps I have it selected but still speaks in English US.
Not supported by Droid Turbo Upgraded to a Droid Turbo and the voice is no longer supported by Android texttospeech
Tone of the voice is good but... I wish they would improve the pronunciation and emphasis to produce a question instead of a statement. It would make the reading of a story more enjoyable.
Since update she stutters like a stuttering parrot and resets constantly I want a refund
