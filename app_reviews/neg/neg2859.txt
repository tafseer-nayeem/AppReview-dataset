Get rid of those ads I understand the need for the devs to make money. Placing ads on a child's game is not the right place to do it. A child pressing on ads means that the game is continually getting interrupted. This makes the parent having to keep clearing the ads screen every minute. Defeats the object really. Find a solution and you'll get more stars.
To many adds I know that u are trying to get money but seriously, In a children's game. They keep pressing the buttons and it's getting on my nerves
Useless rubbish With advert everywhere in the screen. Definitely not for the kids.
Horrible idea to put adds on baby game So your idea of getting rid of ads is to make us pay for some stupid app we don't want Uninstalling there's plenty of better apps for kids that are totally free without stupid ads
Spoiled the app Ubiquitous ad placement means baby cant use this app without triggering the ad and losing the screen. Useless app.
Freezes While my son is playing on it,  it freezes and lags my phone majorly
Really get the words right It's ti not si I uninstalled it because I don't want my children to learn the wrong words. It was a nice colorful and musical app for children but the wrong word ruins it. Fix it and I would use the app.
Ads What baby is going to shop while playing this game need to get rid of ads and it will be a good baby game the

Hate it so much So childish a 2 year old would do it
