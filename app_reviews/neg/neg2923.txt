Sucks The game keeps not loading.  It upsets my kid beyond measure. After paying for the game it should work.
Disappointed The game continually won't load until I uninstall  then reinstall it. When it works, my daughter loves it.
App won't launch keeps crashing I need a fix or a refund asap
Waste of money Won't even open
Ads on a paid game This game is awesome for little ones BUT why is there ads popping up every 2 minutes
App not functioning I tried to reinstall but it still dosen't work. It says it has to download resourse files yet it cannot contact the server. Very disappointing.
The app seems not be loading properly when my child opens the app the screen is white with small objects that can't be made out and she can't complete the tasks due to not knowing what she is looking at for being so expensive it is a poor app and needs fixing
Keeps on crashing Please refund me for this app. I can't even open it, keeps on crashing
BOOOH Cannot be open.contacted google for refund but still charge to the app that is useless. Money , time wasted and device space eater. Uninstall
Awful and i paid for this I have to uninstall this game. It worked for a few days then stopped my daughter is VERY upset and so am I
Not very interactive I wish there was more to do within each routine but it is a very simple app and my two year old was bored quickly.
App Crashed, Wont Even Open When i first downloaded the app, about a week ago, it worked fine. From one day to the other, it just crashes I haven't updated my phone or anything...
