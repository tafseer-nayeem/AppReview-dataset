waste of money game won't even play. it force closes the second you press play. would like it fixed or a refund.
Unplayable. Whenever I play the game, It's always slow and freezes a lot from time to time. These bugs are Reeeeeeally annoying and it messes up the gameplay.
Probably good but... It wont install I have 568MG left
Waste of money Cant even open it.  Its been downloading resources  for 5 hours this is bs
Ehh This game would only occupy a 2 year old. No fun or thrill to proceed or even play again.
Takes to long This app takes way to long to download ive been waiting for hours for it to dowload and it is only 39 ',
Please give my money back
Its good I enjoyed it
I hate it because it does not work on my phone it is getting on my nerves and I mean it I'm not kidding it freezes my phone I deleted it and I am going to tri again to download hope it works
