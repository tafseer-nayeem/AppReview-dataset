Well then Been using this for years... the stop points are crucial if you don't want to scroll through blackness but want an L shaped desktop. But no one seems to know how to use them and Pierre won't give a tutorial. I'll bring it back to 5 stars when he decides to do a quick tutorial.
Interesting idea, poor implementation This launcher is not intuitive at all. Definitely an improvement over more standard launchers, but you'll waste hours trying to figure out how to do basic things, like add an app drawer.
