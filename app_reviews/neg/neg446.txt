You are spreading wrong info As mentioned in titled, here i am giving you the example. When you will open month view it will start with shukla paksha. But none of hindu panchang start with shukla paksha. For example diwali comes on kartik krishna paksha amavasya but your calander showing ashwin krishna paksha amavasya. At present shradh paksha is going on and it is krishna paksha ashwin. But panchang is showing bhadrapad krishna paksha.
Just downloaded. .yet to explore. Can't find Sankrant of every month. If added, then good work.  Thanks
