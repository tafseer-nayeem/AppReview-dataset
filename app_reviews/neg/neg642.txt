Google Nexus 7 I play it in my phone but after some time, my screen gets hot and then i can no longer interact and help Bob. Please make it compatible with Googlr Nexus 7 and ill rate it higher
WHY It keeps on saying it wont respond I wasted my money on this I was really really excited and It hasn't worked for 2 days I restarted my tablet and everything I hate what its doing and you shouldn't waste your money either
Don't buy The controls are fine but the gameplay is so limited. I finished the game in 5 non consecutive hours after getting it. There are only 4 different operations. And honestly it will get boring really quickly after buy. I would just not recommend it.
Crash I was so excited when I got it but it will not come up it just says s s can not come up what a waste of money
It's just so stupid There is no point to it and it's probably the most complicated game I've ever played
Horrible. The controls are terrible. Beyond terrible. This game is unplayable. Yes, at first it is amusing, even hilarious. However, after a few times killing the patient it gets very old very fast. I actually want to play the game as opposed to fighting with the controls to simply break one rib. Plus, there are no tutorials or hints whatsoever. Only good for a few laughs. Don't download if you actually have an interest in playing and succeeding.
My phone cannot run it My phone is HTC M8, and I use 4.4.4 ART mode, I hope the co.can fix the problem
Won't work Ga,me will not function after multiple reinstall .....total waste of money
