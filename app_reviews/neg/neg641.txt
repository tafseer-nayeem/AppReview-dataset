Great game but not optimized It's not optimized for my galaxy note 4. Runs slowly and during fighting with firearms it slows down drastically. Please fix it. The game is a great one I have in on the computer  as well. Buy it's unplayable doe to the bugs that I mentioned.
One problem Love the game but it constantly crashes and i lose any progress. If that problem was fixed i would give a higher rating
Broken interface Very touchy with where you need to select things such as dropping items and taking them. Also couldn't escape a house because the escape door button was behind that side bar, I died so thanks for that assholes
It will download but overtime I try to play it says google store is down, otf All I wanna do is play Haven't even gotten a chance to play
