No choice of cinemas etc. The menu does not work after last update
App with too many bugs The app has given me so many problems before from not showing cinema details, to hanging seating layout, to buffering too long for payment details to be processed. Get this fixed or I'm deleting it. So frustrating.
Doesnt allow me to select cinema Wen selecting a cinema no information comes up
This app just doesn't work I've tried to reinstall but time after time it failed. It doesn't give movies or movie times at all
Doesn't work Doesn't work on s5 wasting my time downloading shouldn't even deserve one star
Why can't I log in I have an account, and I'm part of the SK Club.... I put in my email and password by the login.... ERROR, this happens EVERY time
What's with your seating configuration It's not loading. Big inconvenience App sucks
Stops working constantly Useless app. Doesn't work. Stops working every single time I use it.
Can't make bookings Unable to select cinemas and make a booking. If I can't select cinemas or make bookings why bother with the app
Doesn't open App has not opened for months.
Points Thought will see my points on the app, imporove on that
Why Can't find Westgate mall
Disappointed Can't select cinema and can't book.
