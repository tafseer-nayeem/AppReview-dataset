Not brilliant Having paid for the full version there are then two copies of the program.  The full version for instance does not make any backups.  This leads to data loss and a feeling that maybe some other free app might have been better. Frankly I think I have wasted my money
Doesn't sync with other phones well The syncing on this app is really bad.  I have to press the upload button while my wife presses the download button for her to see my expenses and then I have to get her expenses the same way. We also don't share category names which is annoying. If I rename shopping to groceries or Costco I have to change it on her phone too.  If the app just copied the whole app to both phone so we saw the exact same thing and automatically synced expenses it'd love it.
Changed twice They charged me twice for full download. I need a refund for one immediately please for retrate
Good app. But some budget items will not say it begins at the first of the month, even after i set it to say so. Keeps counting from the second day. Keeps giving me an error message when i try to correct it. As a result , the allotted sum shown is not what i allot, it is the sum minus a day. Very frustrating Wasn't like that when i just bought it. Please fix.                          Update Months now and still no fix. Give me my money's worth Or at least respond. Common courtesy One star less
Waste of money When I first installed the app, it worked very well but after a while some errors appeared. I don't know if the developer still develope this app or not, since there isn't any new version since last year
Ok Ok for now. Had problems last few days will wait and see if it happens again
