Accidental touch I accidentally touched phone screen while playing got an alarm sound but no pointer showing error.   Had to restart puzzle.   I liked it before then.
Puzzles were not well thought out.
Bug Keeped flickering to a blank gray screen an will no longer mark either  x  or o . Froze
Couldn't see 50 puzzles I could only see 5 or 6 puzzles in this and it wanted me to pay three dollars for more. Meh Refunding and sticking to the free ones.
