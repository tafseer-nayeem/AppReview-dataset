The game randomly will freeze up and cause google play services to crash on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 running Android 5.0. It happens fairly frequently and is very annoying. I really enjoy this game, but this is a very frustrating bug. Please fix this and I will change my rating.
Its so hard But amaizing fun game Good game but its so hard I die once then finish the next time. And how do you make games just amaizing game I love it Thank you for makeing very amaizing games
Good game but... I have this downloaded to my android and my sons kindle, both apps are now not letting us jump, these devices are new, nothing wrong with the screens, first the app on my phone started malfunctioning then today my sons app on his kindle
No updates in over a year. The developers haven't released new levels or updated the app in over a year. This is a hit and run, they just release the game and never look back at it. It's not even a good game, it gets repetitive and boring after the first 10 levels.
