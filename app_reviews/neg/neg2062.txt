Where's my McFly Okay, so i bought the BTTF bundle for 10 which was supposed to give me all the outfits, jetpack, vehicles etc. I have all of them except for the McFly outfit Is there any way I can get it I'd appreciate it if you guys can get back to me. I'll change my review to 5 stars after my situation gets handled.
Can't level up Got one badge after level 15 then game glitched and made me a level 30 with all the stars filled out. Now I can't level up at all. When I complete missions nothing happens please fix this I would be a lot higher in level if not for this problem.
This was almost good I loved the game but i watched the video and got the stitched up suit they put it on for me and now they dlnt give me the option to putthe old suit on they give me an option to equip every body but the original
Google Play Games SignIn  Like many of the previous comments, the signin process to JPJ is circular and, therefore, unusable. This is the latest update. The prior update didn't even offer the signin option. It's not progress if it yields the exact same results. Just uninstalledreinstalled on both Lenovo Tab 2 and Galaxy S5 with same non results.
