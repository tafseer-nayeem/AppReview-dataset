Impossible to complete with purchases Ive managed to get so far without having to use the 'Boosts' but ive hit a trial where i can even get a single star without using the Energy Boost and Top Speed boosts. The crappy thing is, if you fall off and have to start again, you lose the boosts. You'll end up with no boosts and then have to pay for them to complete the game. Awful game. Definitely getting uninstalled..
HAVE TO PAY TO FINISH LEVELS. SUCKS I've already paid for the game. Why should I have to keep paying to finish levels Some devs are total jerks.
Grrr, usually great but... Updated phone and lost all progress... Please help
Greedy Bought but impossible to complete without paying more....  Shouldn't be allowed to con people
Fun before it becomes pay to win This game was fun before it turned infuriating in the later levels where its pay to win.
Game is great, but there is one thing that sucks you need to have Internet to play it
Cincinnati Okay game. You need to pay with real money to win.
