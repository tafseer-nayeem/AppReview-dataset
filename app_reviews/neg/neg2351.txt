Just installed the app......it seems to be fighting my tablet for orientation.  Played with it and locked kind of got it to work but, then it cut off a portion of the screen that is necessary.
I got a warning message that Swivel would access whatever I entered into the phone, including credit card numbers. This sounds alarming, and not a function related to its purpose. Should I be alarmed about this I won't use it if it is spying on me.
There is a flaw in this app... I've used rotational apps before... but this one does NOT do it correctly.  It will cut off icons on your screen instead of resizingfixing after doing the rotation.
Overrides app screens Cannot grant root, causes issues also with other apps. Uninstalled.
Not on Gallery Picture gallery doesn't come up on the list of apps that will swivel. That was the one I wanted.
Didn't work at all Didn't carry out its primary function.. Worthless to me. Xperia z2
Kept freezing Kept freezing every time I tried to use the apps I set to a certain orientation
Didnt work Nothing happened to any of the apps selected  gs5
