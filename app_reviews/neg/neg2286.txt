Ads are bad for toddlers. Don't load unless you are prepared to sit and take off ads so your child can play
Terrible I hate it but its great for little kids who want to know how to draw
It will not color App doesnt work
Unusable After 2 or 3 touches it overlaps I think 10 or more pictures and bugs out.
Okay but needed more No zoom, cant draw and fill colors on it. Sketching is very slow. Line appears after I draw it
Would rate higher but game does not load
Ads You spend longer closing ads then playing it.........unistalled same day
