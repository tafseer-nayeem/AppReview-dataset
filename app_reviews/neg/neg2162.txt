Meh Nothing really happens in the game.  It's kinds boring.  Did the whole game in an hour or so. I thought the epic ending was fun though.  It would be fun if it was more diverse.  It needs more on the aggressive side.
Fun but waste of money This game is fun at first but it is too easy to beat, no challange whatsoever, if you buy this you have wasted your money 100
Ok game but..... It was really fun for about 5 minutes then I completed the whole game its not worth the 99 cents they should add more possibilities and more ways to win and other things to steal than just the diamond and its also annoying that you have to install adobe AIR just to play the simple little game
Great game, too short. Insert title here Not worth a dollar since game only lasts 15 minutes to win with all 3 endings.
Waste of money Cant believe it took someone an hour, lasted 5 minutes Feel cheated paying for this
GET RID OF ADOBE AIR GET RID OF ADOBE AIR ON ALL OF YOUR GAMES I CANT PLAY CAUSE I CANT UPDATE ADOBE AIR I WONT BE ABLE TO PLAY I JUST WANNA FRICKING PLAY WITHOUT THE ADOBE AIR NEEDING TO BE UPDATED CAUSE ITS NOT FRICKING POSIBLE Dlt
Why I can't get a refund for this game Why won't it work
Too short but good idea..would not buy anymore from company
Worst game ever You DONT even get to controll your character and u can only choose your actions you will beat the game in 3 mins.
