Love the game BUT..... Love the always will but theirs no obvious way to mute sounds I like to listen to alot of podcast while I play this is impossible as far as I can see currently
Awesome game ruined by no volume control I listen to audio books while playing a game before bed and during my lunch break. This is the only time I play games. The inability to do mute the game makes it so I will never play. Loved it on the wii. Disappointed.
