No good While the main Aviary editor is an excellent app, the filters packs add nothing but fugly unusable filters I would never want to deface my photos with.
Stupid I paid for this crap and now I can't find it in my phone. I know it's a dollar but if I pay for something I would like to use it.
Strange unuseful I bought this application but I can't find it anywhere, where is it No open cursor just uninstall one
