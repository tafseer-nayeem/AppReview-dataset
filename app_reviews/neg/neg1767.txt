The best app when working but at the moment it keeps crashing It's stopped working as it should. It won't let me customise the tabs. It keeps shutting down. It closes when I choose to navigate then opens again when navigation turned of. I have a paid licence and will give it 5 stars if it works properly again.
Great app but it has a major problem Although I purchased CarHome Ultra, the program keeps telling me that the Trial period has ended.  I didn't purchase a trial. Until this is fixed, I am uninstalling this thing. Galaxy Tab 2 10.1
Crashes Was a,  good app,  but keeps crashing and won't let you get anywhere while trying to open it or use other apps
Bad protection choices... I purchased to use this on a tablet mounted in my truck. The problem is they frequently verify your license is valid and require an internet connection.Pulling the tablet out of my truck every night especially considering the way I have it mounted is not something I want to do.
Don't Uninstall and expect to reinstall for free After I upgraded from free version the app got buggy so I uninstalled so I could reinstall again to see if that fixed my problems.  Google play doesn't show me having purchased this the first time
GPS doesn't work. Phone gets very hot when using this app and GPS rarely works at all. If it does work location is wrong. Not worth paying for. Would be a fantastic app if it worked right.
Very buggy...had to uninstall Causing massive problems with bluetooth syncing Note4VW. Song title does not update on the car, the sound cuts in and out nearly every 60 seconds, etc. Uninstalled and the problem went away.
Support is crap If you have a paid license issue, don't count on any support
