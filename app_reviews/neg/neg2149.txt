Started out a good game but now locks the dealing cards half way through a game, if possible fix please
I love this game, but it doesn't love my phone. It made everything slow and not work properly.
Solitaire Autocomplete locks up the game. Also continually reports 208 as score
Use to Love it Not a Good Game. The games are almost identical. The first deal is usually 5 to 6 red cards from 2 to 8. Day after day after day. Then the game gets worse
Favorite game Love this game it's my favorite one, but recently it won't load, please fix it then I will give 5 stars
This is ok but will not allow me to uninstall this app. My phone immediately shuts down. Go back on and it is still there
