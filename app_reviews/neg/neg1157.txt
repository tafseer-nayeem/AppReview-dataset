Lost all my bookmarks   When upgrading from FBReader Free to FBReader Premium it  found all my books and settings but lost all my bookmarks, even though I have bookmark sync turned on.
Missing books It finds only a small fraction of the files that the free version supports. Very disappointing that the premium app is less functional than the free one.
