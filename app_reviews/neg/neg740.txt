Didn't work well for me Crashed on most screens. Cannot search for ticket by ID. Saved filter search doesn't work. Wasted money buying it.
Fix The Agile Boards When trying to view the Agile boards the app crashes. Very disappointed since this was the primary reason to pay for this app. Hiding closed or resolved issues doesn't work either. Looking at issues doesn't show issues from all projects. Basically, this is a truly poor app. DO NOT BUY THIS
