Wtf Whenever I try getting on it it says movie star planet has stopped unexpectedly . Stupid new update doesn't do anything.
It's okay.... It is good now we can give gifts and receive them but still what about movies the quests and your pose for the funding profile Also I DONT HAVE A COMPUTER  so how am I supposed to do all the stuff on the website for msp it's not fair it's just not what about your wishlist and all the stuff HMMM
