No audible pronunciation in this new version Did not really hate it,but it is not working properly it is  not giving audible pronunciation.solve the issue ASAP please.
Doesn't work when internet is off Every time I want to access some web page, it asks me to switch on my internet. I don't always have internet balance.
Why is the audible pronounciation not working The pronounciation is not working with this updated version. Please fix this issue asap, and  you will get 5 star for next version.
Pronunciation For getting exact pronunciation of a difficult word was very easy and useful before I updated it. When I updated it to 4.3 version the pronunciation link has been stopped working.  Now there is no sound.  My device is Sony Xperia m2. It is working perfectly in case of audio.  I hope this problem may be solved within 24 hours.
