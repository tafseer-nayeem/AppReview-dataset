i had previously given 5 stars but with this new update they lost them all. i don't want, need, like or enjoy animations. You interrupt my flow, forcing me to wait on them to finish, because i can't turn them off AND you've made it impossible to uninstall the update. FIX THIS. 1121 Now the cards are all twisted about  are different sizes. What are you thinking Just about uninstall time. I miss the old game  your new version is not worth the irritation.
Hate it now Used to love it till the newest update. I just want to play the game, and if I win I don't need 10 min of screen animations to stroke my ego. Plus I can't even get rid of it Ugh
Why Why does it have to constantly interrupt the game to show the stupid logo We know what game we are playing...we don't need to see the logo every two minutes PLEASE FIX
Primitive and adridden What's up with the video ads And wtf is with this daily challenge crap This game used to be fun. Very close to uninstall time for me.
Stopped All of a sudden says can't deal a winning deal or daily challenges.  My internet connection is fine btw, prob on game site. Disappointed
