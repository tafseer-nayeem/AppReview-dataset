Nothing is improved, still other drivers don't know how to drive and they don't put indicator on when they cross. There is no extra maps available. Some locations have too much traffic lights.
Super In traffic while we stop. The bus all the vehicles  will we go fast bus our bus will go slow . And we will finish the levels after that. Maps are coming soon .l waited for 9months but no maps are came
 the game is free BUT you have to spend money to unlock a bus to start a game. dun download this if you expect a real free game.
COME ON THE BUTTON IS TOO SMALL AND I CANT EVEN CONTROL THE BUS AND ITS LAGGY TOO ugh... I thought this game was awesome but its not and the original bus simulator is WAY BETTER then this one. Come on man ... And also theres too many cars too and i keep crashing them The road is also a problem. Pls fix it
Worst The worst bus simulatot I've ever seen. The cars don't follow any rules they just come and crash on us. The roads are incredibly small. Plzz improve this thing
Bus simulator It hasnt been updated in while.. yall need to update it more a put more routes and buses on it please it gets boring playing the same thing all the time.. AGAIN PLEASE UPDATE IT MORE...
No mirrors There are no mirrors and when you use the steering wheel the whole image of the outside shakes which results in crashes. S5 user
What the hell has happened This WAS my favourite game but for some reason, I hope the developer can answer why, it keeps freezing, crashing, the pedals don't work......you get the idea. It's all gone Pete Tong Fix these stupid mistakes
