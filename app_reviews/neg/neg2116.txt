Updates are to big Every update requires that I delete something because the updates are so big and require a lot of memory. I used to rate the game a 5. I just can't anymore. I cannot keep deleting other things.
great game buggy app great game too bad I can't play it on my Acer since it enjoys freezing more than running wasted money
So I just bought this last night and now launched it for the first time... And it keeps telling me it can't validate the license. I wonder if it might be because I have multiple Google accounts in the device... But some debugging information would be nice  And just to be clear, Internet connection was available albeit slow.
