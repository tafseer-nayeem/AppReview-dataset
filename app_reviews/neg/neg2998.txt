Needs improving The positives.....It is a fun game and keeps the brain active, also plenty opportunity to earn extra points.  The cons.....I really don't like that when you type a answer that the letters do not disappear of screen they're still there.  Also there should be hints like if you're very close they should tell you so that you can change a letter or respell word.
