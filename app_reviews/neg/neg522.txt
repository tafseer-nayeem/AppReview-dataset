Great content  coverage buy Phone vibrates 3 times continuously for a single notification There's no setting of disabling vibrations for notification, in spite of my phone is in general mode, this app gives too much vibration notifications. Ridiculous and It everyday gives notification to update the app for new feature, when I click and open the Playstore it shows no update. Irritating.
i hav tried so much but not able to log in....always showing please wait, then my login failed.......
