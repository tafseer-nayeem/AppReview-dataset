Limited use Does not support .avi files. 90 of my movies are .avi and I'm unable to play them using this app. Please tell me how to make this thing play .avi files.
Disappointing I used to love this plugin and was easily a five star app. Now however it refuses to work with any of my files and worst of all it won't cast movies. This is a real shame because it was my favourite file manager, media player and go to app for Chromecast.
No DLNA and Cast other then Chromecast Can't cast to my smart tv. No dlna and cast other then chrome cast. Please update this plugin like apni cast or any other casting software to make it usefull for all.
Doesn't work on my Galaxy Tab S. It finds the Chromecast Audio device, but doesn't connect to it, just starts searching again if I try to select it. Disappointing, as it does everything else I want.
Use to work great Android 4.2.1 worked at 1  time, had to factory reset, after the reset my mp4 files no longer cast. The Chromecast pic on my tv goes to black, like it's trying to cast but then I get sorry, operation failed error and my screen drops back to the chromecast pic.
Will not play my downloaded movies Everything I try to cast a movie I get an error message that states format unsupported even though the files are MP4 and play on my tablet. Once I try to send them to my chromecast this is when I get the error message.
Doesn't Work, Period Installed on both a Galaxy Tab 3 4.4.2 KitKat and my S5 5.0 Lolipop, and it doesn't do squat on either The loading circle endlessly spins ... sometimes it'll play for a few seconds ... and a little note is always present, saying that it can't perform this operation. Whatever. Back to the drawing board with this one, guys
