Update stops at 89 Having used this for a long time now the new update stops at 89 then turns itself off cant use navmii it stops and turns itself off. Can you fix it please then I'll put it back to 5.
Too slow to update This used to be the best sat nav I had used. With difficulties getting maps downloaded and extremely slow changes to directions on the move,it has become unusable in flowing city traffic. The search is now on for its replacement.
I accept that free software is linked to advertising. I do not accept that ads tell me that my phone is infected with malware. The malware is navmii 
Love this on my Nexus 5 but on my new Nexus 6P it is very slugish on menus, sometimes freezing and becoming unresponsive and it wont install the UK  ROI Maps just sits at 91. Have even removed and reinstalled the app with exactly the same result several times. 
Unstable on moto x style Great navigator with offline maps.  Was good on razr m.  Freezes often requiring exit and restart, especially if gps lock is intermittant, on moto x style.
Navmii They have really ruined this app with latest updates.... Was brilliant but now is useless 
Voices Downloaded advanced voice for 2.39 but can't get it anywhere
Full of ads Older versions were so good. Why this happens to good apps
Not impressed Too damned slow at everything on a motog 1
Experiencing glitch in my Note 4. Voice navigation is saying a completely different navigation from the one shown on the phone screen.
S4 mini I just did a reset my phone and it downloaded the new version of the app, i was using the older navfree version. Now it does not work at all. What the hell Says unable to navigate as there is no carriageway near the current GPS position. Do you have the old apk i can use as it's now useless and taking up 600mb of space
