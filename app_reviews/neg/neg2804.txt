OMG, You suck So, you release a version 6 months ago that has a massive crashing flaw in it in the Calling All Agents portion.  You finally released a patch for it yesterday Sept. 23, 2015 but it doesn't fix the bug  HAHAHA You suck so bad it's hilarious It's a pity, really, considering the work that the poor puzzle designers had to put in to create these amazing challenges.
Fix it I loved this game until it started crashing and now I can't get any further.
After the patch it's even worse Not just the broken level is not fixed, but we also got some bonus crashes from Disney. Where is my fixed game
Update  Version 1.7.1 Just updated  Still crashes when playing Calling all Agents Mission 3 Battle a la Mode on level 3  Samsung Galaxy Note 2
A recent update crashes the app On the calling all agents, the latest batch of levels, on the third level in it, It locks up the program and does nothing. Also the animations in the cut scenes after each level, the animation on doctor doofenshmirtz is messed up. Otherwise I really like this app.
Where's my....... CRASH Loved this game, but since the last patch I can't open any of the levels in Test of a true agent
Still Not WORKING even after a Patch it still does not work. Are you ever going to fix this game
Hmm Ran into that bug everyone seems to be having.
Disney Rip Off 1.99 for less than an hour. Don't waste your money, unless you have lots of it.
Best game ever Yes
Great tool crash
Used to work Here is another example of a great game that Disney has broken. After waiting all this time for new content the game now crashes after the 2nd new level. There are now these types of issues with all the Where's My... games.  It should be renamed Wheres My Game
Please fix. I purchased the extra games, played them, then reset to start over playing again. It's now forcing me to purchase them again. Please correct this. Thanks.
