Riged 9 seconds left in the game, I just scored. Squibed it to the 30. Computer did a pass play, not a hail marry, and magically my db stopped and left him wide open. Got two point con. Went into overtime and loss..
 Make it where you can reomove your auction and bids, took my totw collectible , fix kick and punt returns you can't get 3 yards without seven players in your face
Ok Qb don't scambel and when I was playing they kicked a 56 yard feild need to be fixed
Boooo The defensive players can tackle your guy while being blocked. The QB also can't scramble. There also aren't any penalties.
Change On my old device it was normal but I had to get a new one and it somehow became harder. Think about it who gets beat by the dolphins 31 to 14. It was not hard til 3rd season fix this please.
