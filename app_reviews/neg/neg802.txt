Won't upload vids... when selecting content to load into the tiles for any of the provided formats, it allows me to load pictures, but not videos the reason I purchased pro. It acts like the vids have been selected but never actually loads them into the tiles.
Won't play videos I've tried using this app multiple times and it does not play my videos. I am very upset because I paid to have the opportunity to use two videos and the app won't work.
Unhappy Very unhappy with the paid version. You should be able to zoom in and out to make pictures fit, the video upload only sometimes works, and now it's not giving me the option to upload music The actual interface is way too small. And the paid version should not have vidstitch on the finished video. And the videos won't save or upload  back please.
Rip off I would like my money back I didn't pay for pro just to not be able to play my videos
Freezes Not compatible for Samsung Note 4. I paid for the Pro version and it doesn't capture all videopic frames  regardless of how many or how few are chosen. Also doesn't upload to Instagram as stated.
Fix this please I absolutely LOVED this app Used it alllll the time, but since I just updated its unusable Won't let me save, upload to any social media sites. The music I add says 0000 to 0000 in the editing screen for that. It's just terrible Please please PLEASE fix
Not playing videos Got the vidstitch pro, once I'm done setting all the videos in a collage it will not play or save, and as I read in the recent reply from another user's comment, uninstalling and restalling didn't work either. Lame
Pro version doesn't work. Using the pro vision trying to upload 2 videos together and it keeps stopping each video well short of the original duration of the video. Each should be 10 seconds long and only play for about 3 seconds. Waste of money.
Keeps force closing Every time I try to add my own soundtrack, the app always force closes on me. Once that's fixed, more stars are on the way.
