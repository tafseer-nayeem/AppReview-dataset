Opponent voice not recording on LG G3 I use the pro version and sometimes it does not record and when it does then I am unable to hear the opponent voice. I have tried changing the settings but it still does not work.
Did not record other person's voice on Samsung S4 Recorded conversation but on playback only my voice was recorded the other person could not be heard at all. waste of time do not buy
App full of bugs The app is crashing. The opponent voice is not recording, the app is not updating  is giving error message on Google nexus 5. Plz fix d bugs
Misleading. It doesn't record and if it does, I will transfer 20 pounds per person.
In Pro version on Android 5 list of recordings is not refreshed after call is saved  in free version that worked. Now I have to go back and relaunch app to get latest call... Please fix, itherwise great app
Sucks I can record and download it just fine. But I can't play it, convert it, or edit it.
Always stops This app should have root permission because it stops every time a memory booster runs
Does not work after buying the Pro version It says error after each call. Does not work. Money down the drain
Why some call reconding inspite of the contact name shows hidden please reply
Opponent voice not recording. I am on a Note 3 and worked really well until I had to do a factory reset last week. Since then it will not record opponents voice. Tried all settings. I have had this app since 2013 with no problems until the factory reset. Really disappointed and uninstalling.
It save only my voice
Can't hear the caller loud enough when recording
