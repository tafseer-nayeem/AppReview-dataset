Language problems The app is forcing me to use Chinese even though my phone is set to English. Where is the option to change the language of the manhwa to English  There is no  option in the .  Your stupid help page is obviously copied from the one for your iOS app and even the description for this one is copied from the App store.  This app has no multi language support. I'm flagging you for false advertising.

Why Used to love this app so much. But I hate it whenever I change the language, ex from English to Indonesia, my previous favorite webtoon in English language were deleted. I hate it sooo much since I have to remember in which episode I stop reading. Wh I change the language Because the content of those two language is different 
when I read Shiver, at the bottom, I have not had time to read it but it had closed itself. I've close the app and open it again, but it remains closed itself. it is very disturbing while reading. please fix it asap, cause i really love this app.
