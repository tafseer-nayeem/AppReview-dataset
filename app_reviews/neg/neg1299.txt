Ridicule a customer Smooth move.... I'm confused. Do you have to use non factory launcher I didn't see that information anywhere and can't see how to get it to work on current setup. Galaxy S6 with newest OS and factory launcher. After response from dev great customer service. Stand up guy. Keep my dollar. You can change reviews after you get a response.  Not sure if you knew that. I'll keep mine where it is. Good day. It does say CM theme engine and many more at the end of the launcher list.
Wow Colors are way too dull. Icons suck
