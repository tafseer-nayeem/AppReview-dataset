Chart Not Available With new update the chart is not available. Earlier it was a 5 Star app for me  Found the bug... Immediately after I try to add PSAR indicator the chart is no more available...  Please fix this
The notification problem Whenever the notification come and we click it after some time  , then the news tab opens but the new which was notified through the notification is not seen anywhere .
Redirection and portfolio updating Very tiresome and not user friendly to update or view portfolio. Money control is better with new version.  Also doesn't take to the news article 99 time from the notification, but instead to the main page. Navigation through the news articles needs improvement.
