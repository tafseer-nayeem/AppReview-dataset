Ads Why the fukk are there ads in this game that I paid for Eat shiiiit. Never paying for one of your games again.
NO I paid money for no ads. Now there are ads. Removing all Angry Birds franchise apps. Never again.
Advertisements W t f...  I paid for this game.  And I still get ads
Premium version with ads. Complete waste of money... Paid for non ad and still get ads.
Excellent Game, latest update causes it to stutter during gameplay like crazy Unpaid version works fine, smooth, like all the other AB series. But this version stutters during gameplay bad
I paid for this game and hadn't played it in a while, I get on to find that I can't even play it I opened my game after recently updating it, but whenever I try to play a level, it freezes. The music plays well, but it just freezes on the course overview Please fix it ASAP
TOTAL CRAP Won't even let me play. It just blacks out whenever I click the icon. Please fix
Black screen on SGS4 Used to work but now it shows a black screen after a short time. I paid for this app and demand a fully functional game.
Updates make this too laggy to use Recent updates to this game have rendered game play impossible. Should this not be resolved with the next update,  I shall have to uninstall it.
Does not work On my G6 at all
good but not working any more good game, payed for it. But now it crashes at launch, every time. Have uninstalledinstalled several times. Asus MeMopad FHD 10
