Great game.... Online The game itself is well made and enjoyable but it's ridiculous that it needs constant Internet access... This game isn't online and I don't always have Internet that's why I downloaded a game that's over a gigabyte.... Please remove the Internet connection necessity... This game is literally under the no WiFi No problem section and this is a CRIPPLING problem..
Horrible English Dub... Can't even get past the first scene the moment I heard the voice over. Give an option for Japanese voice with English subs.
