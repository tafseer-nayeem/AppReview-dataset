Fkuke Ad doesn't even come close. Don't waste your money. Last sat pouring rain app said dry.
Takes forever to load I love the concept of this app and I think it works well, but It needs to load faster, in fact it won't even load on my Galaxy S6 right now as we speak.   Please fix
Cant install Will not install on samsung s3. I see no option to get it refunded
Lacking in features for price You check the app to see if it's going to rain. There should be some way of setting up notifications especially since all other free weather apps show pretty much the same data. Interface seems outdated.
The app should notify you when rain is approaching without having to open it.
Garbage It's pouring out yet the app tells me it will start raining 20 minutes from now.... checked back about 30 mins later and it says it's dry.... while there is a downpour....glad I was able to get a refund
