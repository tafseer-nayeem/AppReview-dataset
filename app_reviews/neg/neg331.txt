Really am not too happy with this game Had to uninstall after I have gotten so far in the game during this summer. And now because it wouldn't load up every time I log in, it shuts down on me. So had to uninstall and reinstall.  Now have to start all over again from the beginning to get back to where had been. Sucks that it don't let me pick up to where I was last. Rated this a 5 star now rating this a 2 cuz am not happy to have to start over. 
Terrible This game has 1 issue When Granny is bashing punks, she turns to slow. I would be turning 15 s. Ahead but she still turns to slow
Frozen All the time when I want to press exit it freezes and says angry  gran run is not responding over and over again so I don't really get to play the game.
