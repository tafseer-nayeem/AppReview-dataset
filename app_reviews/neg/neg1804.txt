Can't work after latest update I keep getting the message that the app has stopped working after last update. Phone screen freezes and can't use the phone until i reported the problem sent feedback. Please fix or i will uninstall. On Samsung Galaxy Note, first model.
Lack of options and closed code So many options for years not implemented and now whatsapp is simply copy pasting the features telegram creates. Moved to Telegram which is whatsapp but on steroids which even offers desktop integration so you can use it on the pc and more.
Subscription model sucks They used to auto extend everyone's subscription for free. Now that Facebook bought it, they aren't. I would like the option to pay a one time infinite usage fee like iPhone users. Why are you gouging Android users
I'm very annoyed with this now, since the last few updates one problem is that even after I've selected in my setting I don't want notification pop up on my screen it still shows and the pop ups are annoying especially as they don't go away quickly. FIX IT PLEASE
Voip call does not always go through. You are always deceived that its ringing at the other end which is not true. Tried with two phone at same place. If there is no connection, the phone should not give an impression that you are connected
