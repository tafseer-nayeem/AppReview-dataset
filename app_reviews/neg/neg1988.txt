i'm pissed off i do love at first.. but when i nearly reach level 31 i can't open this app. anymore. all went black.. i am really pissed off.. i've earned 150,000 coins, I've got 48 diamonds, complete food., finished some of the missions and a lot of achievements .. aRrrggGg
Not for kids. Bad ad upon exit of game My 8 yr old loved the game but VERY VIOLENT advertisement for Crazy Wheels pops up with impalement and bloody limbs falling off a kid. Not cool. I will not support this app maker in the future.
Nicely designed Graphics are pleasing, and the games are fun The pet doesn't seem to die if you don't check in often, which is very convenient. HOWEVER to grow from boy i need a gold in ALL mini games. I'm good at a few but no way as hard as some are am I able to achieve that It's unreasonable that I can't even buy off that mission with diamonds or any way around it. Ultimately I'll stop playing because of that. Sad.
