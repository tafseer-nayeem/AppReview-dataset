Inaccurate info A lot of the review and practice exam questionsanswers provide highly inaccurate and false information. There were several answers I knew to be correct but was told they were wrong only to confirm my answers were correct when I researched the information in both the Pearson VueBrady Emergency Care book AND the Jones and Bartlett AAOS Emergency  book. At this time I can not recommend that this is a helpful app.
Has outdated info Good study guide of it was up to date, and didn't suggest things like suctioning an infant for 10 seconds. I'm getting my money back.
