Multiple freezes, daily. You WILL win tourneys that also freeze  and no longer replace entry tickets. I've gone from 5000 to 1800 in 5 days.  It would be THE best game if they would ever get it fixed.  Most loved falling to most hated
Upset I love the game but when play the five day challenge it never gives the big prize...being playing and don't get the prize about 90 of time.
I've won about 45 Blitz Tournaments this week but have not been awarded the prize tokens because the screen freezes and I get nothing. Is there a way I can receive these Also, I never get the 5 day reward for the Daily Challenge.
Woo hoo Hanging friends was big let down, but love scramble friends
