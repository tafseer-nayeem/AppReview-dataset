Great app but force closes The app used to work great ans my daughter loves it but it force closes several times and locks up my phone before it actually opens and when it finally does open she can maybe play for 5 minutes before it closes again. Galaxy s4. Several reinstalls hasn't fixed it m will change to 5 stars if you ever fix it
Too many glitches Kid loves it but it constantly stops working. Cannot play it for 5 minutes without it unexpectedly stopped working. Also the music still plays when app is closed out. Have to restart my phone to get it to stop. Save your 1.99.
Music wont stop After we close this app  it continues  to  play  the song. Even plays while new app and music are  playing
Wont download. Read the first 2 reviews and thought.  Cant go wrong with this app for my child to play. Should of read the rest. Tried time and time again to download it without any success.  Giving up now. Spider may off went up the spout but my money went down it.....    
the latest update causes the phone to crash when dropping hats fix these issues please
White screen White screen during rain
Doesn't worth the money Verry limited.
No longer working It worked great the first time but has gone to the white screen. I have uninstalled, restarted my galaxy tab, and reinstalled. I think my grands will love it once it is fixed.
Not happy, useless The first time I tried to use it, it was corrupt and the app did not appear fully loaded. Very disappointed. It is completely unusable.
Blank spaces in graphics I downloaded both this app and the wheels on the bus. Both have large blank spaces in the graphics where the moving parts should be. I emailed the company and have heard nothing. Would like a fix as i have heard they are good apps.
Waste of money I don't understand what is the learning for kids in this game. A utter waste of money
Cheat I hear back ground music, a house, and moving white boxes. Clueless what to do.
