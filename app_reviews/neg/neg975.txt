StarsPlanets Move How is it that when I'm pointing my phone at the very visible stars and planets, they all move from the spots they were just at even though I never moved my phone  Buggy.
Works but... Cannot access ANY settings.  When settings drop down is touched, sky is still visible but gray.  Tried search for sun, screen appeared to flash for a second and nothing happened.  This app used to be the best of all astronomy apps out there.  Please fix.  Thanks  galaxy s5, lollipop 5.0
What happened At first the app was working, its amazing. But after about two days it stopped. Whenever I moved my phone the screen stayed in the same position. I really liked it but now it's making me frustrated.
Calibration Need to fix the calibration. Have my gps location turned on on s6 but compass on Skyview app is pointing  in wrong direction. Fix it b4 i buy it
Not functioning And East is North, just for good measure. ..
Fake This app does not point anywhere. Its a animation over your camera. IE point the camera and leave it still, the stars move away. Fake as
Always running I could rate this app as 5 stars. But it's unacceptable when an app is ALWAYS running in background, even when I have not used it since last system restart. I can accept this only for some kind of apps, like the ones for email, messaging, etc. This app's behavior is very suspicious.
As stated before... the compass is off... east is west and south is north. ..
Neat but poor function Why is the orientation all wrong When I face south the display shows NW but the compass is still south. With my device clamp still the stars and planets move all over the place. Not  good aid for star watching.
Compass is always off. North is always pointing east
Camera is upside down Nexus 5x
Pathetic App Doesn't work for Xperia Z2
