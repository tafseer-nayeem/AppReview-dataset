Lacking some crucial features Looks great and all But... Unfortunately it lacks the ability to create own exersices, and with a limited library of only a 100 exersices, compared to 1300 in several competitors, this one falls short. I do have the full pack, and i'm aware of the workout builder, but this doesn't  let you create own exersices, just your own workout with the already predefined exercises
Seriously Have to buy all of the workouts, video ads that pop up when I close it. I'll stick with one of the many better options, heck a pen and paper is superior.
App want money from beginning. Did not find any free workout.
App bt I don't like it
Not complete Lacks a lot of exercises
Content unavailable in the U.S. Unlocked the app for 3.99 only to find out it uses random videos from YouTube to explain the workouts...surprisingly enough this includes foreign videos that not all user's can watch. Requested a refund via email and it was refused because it's not a Total Fitness problem
