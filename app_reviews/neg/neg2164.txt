Everything's going wrong First it took me three tries to download because an error message kept popping up and saying it was corrupted. Then when it finally downloads and I open it up I can hear the background musicsound of fire crackling but the screen is black. Tried forcing it closed and reopening but it still won't work. Samsung Galaxy S6.

The bug is still there. I'm stuck on the first catalog...every time I try to buy the picture the one that uses your pictures from your phone it restarts the game and doesn't buy the picture to burn. I have an android Moto G...please fix this bug so I can enjoy this game and rate it five stars. I love this game and it sucks that it has this problem.
