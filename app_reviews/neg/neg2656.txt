Short game got to level 95 and now we beat the game. Thats bad business folks smh... where's the rest of the game....
I hate this game. I hate this app. The most annoying thing about it is that it is not consistent at all. Some times, it wants you to give the brand name, sometimes it wants you to give the name of the product. The most rediculous one, is a photo of Pilsbury Cinnabon toaster strudel. Whats the answer for this rediculousness TOASTER What the hell. Put some effort into your game.
Thought was gonna be a challenge at first then..I ran out of levels after just starting to play. Not to mention everytime I go back in I have to go to setting and shut off the sound if not it's annoying the only app I can't shut it off once and be done...o don't have the slow motion or have to push the letter several times problem like some have stated. Other then that would be a good game..but can't believe levels are done already.
Never play this game It has food we do not even know. It is too easy sometimes. I like challenges. It glitches on my phone so every time I go to play it kicks me out. not fair. I'm suggest u do not load this on your  phone. Its not fun for your kid or an learning toy.
Inconsistent... Its fun,  but it starts. To ask for brand names, then product flavor,  and then sometimes just the answers don't make sense...
