Took my money... Bought a pack of bars as i got to last card on a stage im stuck on. Purchase successful it said. Then when i tried to buy the bars it said no money taken from your account. So now youre stealing. I would like my bars or money back now
Bad changes on update They made a change where after you run out of turns it has a large button that comes up for you to spend bars to continue. It pops up on way you unintentionally hit it and lose bars.
Update lost my games Been playing this for over a yr n now with this update I lost my status.not very happy about having to start over,so haven't played since.frustrated n disappointed
Addicting Love it but lately everytime i win a level it force closes on me. Please fix
Some levels impossible without paying Level 566 is clearly a level you can't pass without spending money. It's disappointing. I would understand if it cost to download, but it's a free game. Challenging is fine, but impossible seems dirty.
Installed it and can't even play it. It keeps say that it's not responding very disappointed uninstalling
