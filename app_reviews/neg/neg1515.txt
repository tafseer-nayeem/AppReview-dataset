Very unusable UX I take the purchase as a small donation to devs, keep the good work Pls consider that double tap is very difficult to make, I am not able to open the files  Update Too much frustration to take and look up notes, uninstalling for now.
Waste of money Don't buy it none of the functions like tagging search or search are working. This app is total garbage and a waste. None of  other reviews in praise are authentic
Ok, but UI is bad I understand that you want to replicate the look from desktop app, but it's not very usable on Android. You can't swipe from folders to notes and it's hard to use. Maybe you should use Material guidelines because the app is not worth the money if it stays this way. On the other hand, desktop app is great.
Reasons I deleted this Should not be a paid app. 1 too complicated and no tutorial video. 2 tagged an item but that tag was not added to my tags list.  AWESOME IDEA but huge disappointment. This should be labeled alpha or beta and in  Play store beta release stage.
