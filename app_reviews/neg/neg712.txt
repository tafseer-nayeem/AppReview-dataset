Do not buy full version,updates like once a week P
Put more pic Very short selection 
Not enough pics The pics are cute and funny, but stick with the free version. Not enough new ones. Maybe this will improve in the future, and I'll give more stars.
Very very limited Ok app. Bought pro version. Very few pics. Get notified each day about updates but nothings new. They same pics are featured in more than one category. Dissapointed. Wish I had not gone pro.
Anything new coming Same pics for two weeks. Otherwise awesome.
