Tried to get a refund but was 12 hours too late. The controls don't seem to work well on my Galaxy 5. The ball would barely apply spin no matter how hard I swiped. Add to that the grinding nature required to get better paddles In order to beat harder opponents made it all the more frustrating. Maybe I just suck at this game, or maybe this game sucks at ping pong
Condescending and mean If you do badly it calls you a Big Loser,  and when you need out of a match it always asked are you a quitter yes it no. Don't want a game that tries to make me feel bad about myself.
