Tutorial broken Couldn't even make it through the tutorial because it was forcing to use a card that required more AP than I had, not to mention how long it took me too get there because it takes me at least 20 tries to select something on the board
It's trash Buy at your own risk
Tutorial duel broken Tutorial makes me try and play a card with more ap than I have as it also made me attack beforehand. No you don't have enough ap, finish your turn message, very poorly executed.
This WAS a great game. When I bought this game it was awesome now after a few updates it is laggy and even a little fuzzy, so slow its unplayable for me. Please fix these problems.
Buggy, can't even run mission 3 Please reconsider purchasing this, would gladly take up a refund. Firstly, graphic is still crap despite all the comments. Tutorial could be better with something like click to proceed. Fix the gameplay as many got stuck trying to actually play the game
Avoid the Unity upgrade for now. Card art is super low res, the translucent cards are impossible to read, the animations are almost as obnoxious as the new music. Overall a significant downgrade. However, the core gameplay is still cool and there might be some hope in the future.
Annoying bug Decent game, but if you switch to check messages or if you receive any phonecalls then you lose all save progress because the game goes irreversibly blank when you switch back.
