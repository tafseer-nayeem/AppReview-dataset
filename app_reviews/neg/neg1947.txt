Expensive The game might be fun for about 15inutes, but 30 euro for a bike is ridiculous. For that money i can buy the new starcraft expansion with a solid singleplayer campaign and endless hours of multiplayer.
Can't start new multiplayer games anymore. Lot's of levels only available with a facebook account.
Updated the app and it erased all of my progress. It's still showing my multiplayer wins from before I updated but other than that there's nothing.
Bug Don't let me play a game when I click to play then the screen goes black
Cant even go straght without tilting so it looks like im texting tall ways
Why does my friend have the world tour right now and I don't
Rip off We paid for the desert got charged but never received it please refund us now
