Good game but always crashing When i play maybe around 15 minutes  30 minutes always hangcrash.. please fix it.. i like this game.. but if always crash is make me boring to play it..
Was going good untill update I was doing well and enjoying the change in game style from the standard games I've been playing however since the update the game keeps crashing out after about 1 level. Ok it's been ages now and despite emailing support and sending in crash reports I've heard nothing back and I still can't play the game
Fun, but It was fun initially,  but bogs down when it is 50 ships against one.  Some missions are just stupid.  Protect ally ship as your goal... yeah its heavily stacked in favor of making you spend money to upgrade.  You cant shoot or navigate fast enough to save your own ship let alone ally ships that just sit there.  Very slow to update the app and add new ships and levels, is boring as I've reached the end long ago and can only go back and replay previously completed levels
Stopped working After the last update it won't open I'm not very happy with it
so good and yet so bad wow i like this game so much but the huge problem it has is the way we the players get gold which is the problem we play 4 stages to get just 5 gold which is bad compared to gunship battle which has a lot of stages to choose from we suffer playing for a long time to just get 400 gold which is bad pls reduce this.
My money abd gold are dissappearing The game is losing my gold and money. For example I had 455 gold until yesterday during the 8 p.m. worship time. Now it's down to 306 and only 150,000 instead of the 267k that I had to begin with. I haven't bought anything and this is the 3rd time this has happened. You guys need to fix this and replace what you dissappeared.
Nicely hijacked My first,second and rented nagato or whatever is going backwards not atking and crashing every ship sad
