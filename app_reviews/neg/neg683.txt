Sony Z3 Why bother if u can't make the buttons lock Every 2 minutes my child 17 months exits the game and has then got access to stuff up any settings Get it right and I'll give u 5 stars.
Too many ads This would be a great program if not for the ads. I downloaded this for my son,  and he manages to exit the program after less than a minute.  Banner ads are always on the top or bottom of the app,  which clicking on opens a page.  Also there are numerous pop up ads.  That makes this app totally useless and a piece of trash.  Do not download
Lock out app...what a joke This is a joke, this is NOT a lock out app. 1 Your child can easily click the button to unlock it. 2 When your child clicks on the ads, it beings them completely out of the app to the Internet and then to your phone. What a joke
My 22 month old loves to sing all the songs. However, I give it only 2 stars because the ads are terrible I have to keep coming back to fix it after he clicks on them every 5 minutes
How dense can you be as a developer to put clickable ads in a baby app.. I just can't fathom it.. It's completely useless.
Would give it a zero if I could. There are say ads in HORRID places that my kid ALWAYS hits them. The game is stopped all the time. It's It's a toddler game for goodness sake. Stop with the ads. Taking it off my phone. Much better ones out there.
