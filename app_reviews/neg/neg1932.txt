All progress gone Went to continue my game today, and the option to continue is gone. I have to start a new game. But, why would I if it's just going to disappear again Zero stars. Negative stars. 6 wasted. Nexus player.
Unplayable on Nvidia Shield TV due to bug that turns the screen black when using iron sights and quick time events. Please fix.
Could not be downloaded I constantly got a error 905 telling me it couldn't be downloaded due to an unknown error. I either want a fix, or my money back asap.
 Apparently if your in a multiplayer lobby full of Noobs and they report you, then your account will be banned forever with no evidence to prove any cheating was used. thanks  gameloft
Love the game... But  Every time I die on multiplayer. The app freezes. It... Really is kind of a kill joy. Literally.  If I could get some help for this... It would be helpful o Oh... And gyroscope would be nice for my Nexus 5...
What is the problem gameloft I paid for this game and for the last 6 months i can't join multiplayer, it just loads and gets stuck loading Severely upset with Gameloft.
Really laggy and choppy Why is the game play so choppy on Galaxy Note 4 It's not my Internet connection for sure. Please fix it because multilayer is almost unbearable. I won't be playing for a while until the game runs better.
