Outdated. I usually hear about upcoming Jordans from other sites way before they're even mentioned on this app... I honestly only check the app once every 3 or 4 months but it doesn't update often enough for even that sometimes. Use to be better.
Notification Once you get a turnoff notification switch, ill rate this app five stars
Android Money Grab, App is Flawed. Half assed app compared to the Devs iOS app. No settings, doesn't confirm to Android's design guidelines. No swiping between columns... Better free apps out there. Save your Money
