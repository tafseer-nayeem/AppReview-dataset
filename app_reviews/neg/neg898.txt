It was better Three months ago, the free version integrated right into my fitness pal. Then it stopped working. Upon reading the info for the paid version it looked like it would, but it doesn't either. Aside from that, the ap works great and I love the features and how it works. Just wish it would talk to myfitnesspal again. 817 Now music doesn't work properly. Seems like it's going downhill fast. Pretty disappointed I paid for this ap.
Free version is just as good Wishing I hadn't paid for this. The pro version doesn't give me tracking for the walk run pace differences or any mapped tracking for my routes. I have to use other apps to get this info.   Is it that difficult to build an app that combines these features   I do however LOVE the C25K training schedule.
Kept crashing I love the idea for the app.It worked well at first but once I got to the third week it started crashing especially if I was switching songs. I didn't like to have to start over or try doing the app without music. I even uninstalled and reinstalled just in case but it didn't work.What a bummer that it didn't work.
Crashes constantly Crashes in the middle of runs all the time. Very annoying and unhelpful.
