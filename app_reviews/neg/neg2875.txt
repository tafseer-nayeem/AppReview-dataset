Great but.... Its great but it keeps turning off a shuting down my tablet. I payed 2.99 and I want to play it Please fix or tell me how to fix it
I can't refund it So annoyed. I'm not going to install any more toca boca apps. Anyway, its a rubbish app, you cant do anything with them, its really hard to do hair, you can only have 4 eyes 2 noses and 2 mouths, no chance of doing a weird monster then. Its also a pain that you can't do free drawing on it, and the fact it won't refund. Sooo soooo annoying
