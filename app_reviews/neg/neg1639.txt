Loading.....still loading.....loading.....screen turns black....still loading..... Why does it take so long for everything to load on your app I really have to pick and choose an article to read in fear of when I click it I'll have to wait for disappointment. The loaf times are freaking ridiculous. Update 1112015 I found another app that is 150 better and doesn't take forever to load articles. DELETE
Great BEFORE UPDATE Sucks now with this update Just keeps loading and can't even see the releases. App is useless now
Loading forever It's a non stop circle going forever. Always have to redownload it everytime I try to get on.
It's ok It works great then it won't load.  It's decent but... Uninstalling and then installing is a waste
NEVER Loads Open up the app and it never a ctually loads. Quite pointless. I need Sneaker news to launch an app
Everytime i click to see a picture it takes a long time to load up
Loading...... THE APP DOESNT LOAD WITHOUT WIFI sneakernews is better tbh
Never ending loading App will constantly show loading and I have to restart my phone to get it to work again.
Not able to download the app... Says installing for hours but never installs
Loading It's still loading please take a look at it
Won't let me Log In I can't log in to it nor can I use and the options on the side bar nothing but the release reminder
Just went down hill with this new upgrade
