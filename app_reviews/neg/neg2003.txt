worked fine until latest update i love this game and own the board game as well as the android version. since the latest update, the tablet version is unplayable, the screen just flickers and dies. please fix
Broken game My Android tablet seems to have serious problems with pinchzoom and map movement. Got stuck unable to see the game board, couldn't place tiles, couldn't move the map. Additional problems with icon artifacts remaining when hiding panels. I would  like a fix or a refund.
Critical Bugs Ignored This game always locks up when I zoom out. In a paid app a bug like this is inexcuseable. The fact that many other users have pointed out the same bug and it is STILL unresolved is troubling. Do not waste money on this broken and ignored game.
Dang it Google I always leave comment under apps I tried and refunded. I saw no comment here and bought it. then comment appears. No refund, and money lost on app I won't ever launch. sad
Single player crap The vs computer will win every time due to luck of draw Always goes to computer. Computer also always plays to win your individual goal. Hope the developer chokes on my money. POS
Dry .... and boring, boring, boring, boring, boring Graphics look like they belong on a  breakfast cereal packet. Instead try Race of nations Through the ages, vastly better game for free.
Glitchy Does not play anything like the board game. Single player campaign often marks you as failed despite fulfilling all the requirements. Feels unfinished.
Fix Bugs Pinch to zoom loses city.  No explanation of some scoring changes. Music plays on startup with no option to turn off.
Love the game, hate the app Pinch zoom was erratic on my Sony Xperia.  The city tiles I was building drifted up and offscreen. No amount of pinching, dragging,  or cussing brought my city back on screen. Had to quit without finishing.
Hard to learn It really need at better tutorial for players who are not familiar with the board game version.
