I liked it until If your using this app and you paid for it and like myself like to flash roms guess what it won't work for the paid part of it on another Rom being there license verification sucks. Beside that it's a good app
le service n tait pas d une extrme prcision, et maintenant tous est payant.  fuir.
 
Probably the database needs updating Install this just 3 hours ago, use this to pick up my kids from school... the road that suppose to be 30mph speed, showing 50 mph. I guess this is not for me... if there is a speed camera and i dont know the area i could have speeding ticket without knowinh... i think you should update your data often. I am from UK by the way.
Please read. Might be okay. I admit I didn't take and try this in my car. From what I read I would need to purchase to use recording. Unless I know this works I'm not buying. Sorry, might be a great app. I didn't know what to give it as a rating due to not being able to fully try it.
