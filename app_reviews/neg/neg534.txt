Samsung GALAXY S6 active The updates keeps crashing and then it trys to restart it self it's in and out.
Notifications for the most part are incredibly annoying, and I wish there were more granularity in how I can set them. Why am I getting notifications for players on my bench whose status changes, especially on a Monday when those players are locked anyway It's mind boggling
One of the worst updates i've ever seen. Live projections are unnecessary and overlap with the dumb football icon. The old unobtrusive line that indicated possession and red zone was far superior. Also you got rid of the ability to switch between rosters and stats on the head to head screen which was a very good feature.
Still crashing.. COME ON YAHOO. PLEASE FIX ALREADY After 3 updates, the app still constantly crashes.  Smh.
Create an account Decent app if you want to do recreational fantasy stuff. Makes you create a yahoo account that you will literally never use for anything else and doesn't have an easily found search for open leagues. Make it open to all email accounts and my rating goes to 4 stars.
So much better Latest update helped matchups so much actually have current predictions. Give you 4 for now. Will get 5 if baseball in the spring has these improvements that football has gotten
Keeps freezing I have read other feedback  tried reinstalling this app numerous times. It still continues to freeze as of late  will not connect to Yahoo Sports at all to allow me to see the gamecast. I loved this app but now it's becoming a headache.
PAY ATTENTION You guys gotta start paying attention to the GAA in the NHL. In no point in time should a relief goalie with 1 GA have a GAA of 7.03, because the starter let in 6. Fix it.
