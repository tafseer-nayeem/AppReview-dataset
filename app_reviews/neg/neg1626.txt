Good concept but.. So the app is good in concept an they seem to be on their way but who lists these prices, a hypebeast Come on, 06 Fire Red V's valued at 185 210 for Chutney XX's Lol its like the app is run by someone who didn't start collecting until 2010. And those two aren't even the worst of it. It's like half the prices are deadstock prices and the other half beat prices. Pretty disappointed I paid for an app that prices shoes like a hypebeast, shame.
Unable to do anything I can't add to my collection I am unable to see release dates. I can't do anything
Frustrated I concept is great but the app doesn't work. Once you put a shoe in your collection you can't take it out. There a couple of Kobe 8's missing. No Barkley posite's. If you have more than one of the same sneaker it sometime just post it twice then won't let you delete either.
Nothing past jordan 7's for me Can't see the prices or add anything to collection past jordan 7. Pages don't load properly.
Can't even add shoes to my collection on my Note Edge
It wont show anything past the 1's It shows no pic's besides the air jordan 1
