Ads ruin it The ads on the screen make it impossible for children to play. How much sense does it make that you have to double tap to get to the home screen but click an ad once Would be great if the ads weren't always on the screen
Ads ruined this app This is a great app and my child enjoyed it greatly, it was a 5 star in my opinion. The problem came when they added ads, which is so close to where your kid is going to want to press. This acts free but isn't playable for kids unless you pay to remove the ads. Very disappointed with this update.
Ads ruin it It's no fun for the kid if you have to guide their hands the whole time and constantly close out of the ads. I want to play WITH my daughter, not FOR her.
Ads need sorting You have parental control features for the menu button and things like that but the Ads need just one press Uninstalling for that reason.
Well, My nephew didn't like this one cause it was to boring but I recommend another one  and it's hard to deleting  it
Ads in the way of playing, not paying for such a simple game to get rid of them.
Does not teach the colors black and white.  Why They are 2 of the main colors.
Ads ruin it My baby is constantly distracted by annoying ads. She keeps pressing them and exiting the program. Very frustrating.
I want to give 0 star but i can't .i download it but it doesn't open...
Best app My child favorite this app
