What's with the lack of new levels and yet so many updates that are pointless. What does Trained roto so he can carry more weight even mean
The advertisements are ridiculous Even paying to remove ads, you still get prompted to visit the store in between EVERY level. They also force you to beat the level several times in different, boring game modes in order to advance.
THE ADS are Fkn RUIN the fun of the game Can't even hit the x button No way.....uninstalling it
i  it and it is so great
