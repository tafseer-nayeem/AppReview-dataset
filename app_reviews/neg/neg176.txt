Not the same as the iPhone version I had this app for the iPhone and loved it. For the android version you have to open a PDF of each protocol. Kinda defeats the purpose  of you have to go to a different app to view it. Not worth the price.
Won't download protocols. Won't download protoccols. Gave up and uninstalled.
Discontinued Hey thanks for letting me spend 10 dollars on your service just so you can discontinue it. Terrible.
Locks up and will not load Will not load and just locks up
Unimpressed Just slightly more useful than just downloading the PDF from the state website.  Other than being searchable, it's the same thing.
Meh.. Basic pdf viewer. Required 250 service setup fee in addition to purchase fee and annual update fee. Doesn't show distances to receiving hospitals.
