It sucks Sorry to say it but this game kinda sucks I liked it on the computer but this one is so laggy plz fix bc I really like this game and I want to play it
It won't give refund I didn't want to keep it because I just didn't like it and now it won't give me my refund 
Hmm... The rounds go too fast, would like it more if it didn't feel uncontrolled, this speed feels more like a bug or glitch than a purposeful thing
8 LEVELS 8 8 GIVE SUM MORE LEVES I DO 1 OVER AND OVER AND OVER I ITS GETING BOINGE
