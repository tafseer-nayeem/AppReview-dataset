This app is a joke, and should be taken down for false advertising. In the description it says you will get hurricane tracking and storm warnings. That is 100 false You click on hurricane tracking and what does it say...upgrade. I've also emailed the creator of this app no response, save your money.
My radar Paid for warnings, watches  My radar ripped me of on my iPhone  now , same ripoff on my Samsung s5 active new,  ATT . BEWARE MY RADER IS A RIPP OFF  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY 
Accuracy sucks and have bought the hurricane addon twice. Still asks me if I want to upgrade to see hurricanes. Uninstalled.
Forecast unavailable So what the hell happened to forecasting in Puerto Rico It worked for years Radar works.  You have many PAID users here. Please try to fix it.
Sick and tired... Some how previous purchases are cancelled You will get refund requests for your approval and the other two updates addons  total crap.... Sucks too because it works perfectly......
Hate that it starts on its own. Drains resources.  Don't start the app unless i initiate it. Especially if I'm paying for it.
Winds The winds option is not in my layers. Can not put them on my radar. So sad. The only reason I bought it. They told me maybe my graphics processor in my phone is not strong enough and it won't show the option maybe So.... I guess if you have a nexus 7 or slower don't bother in finding the wind layer on the app.... OK.
Unable to download in app upgrades Have Pro. Need Hurricane upgrade and app does nothing when I press purchase.
Had been getting increasing problematic I've sent in reports  nobody replies or fixed. Still having problems with the radar, weather  now notification are all gone, very frequently. It's not very stable, clearly. Maybe docking a few stars will get their attention. UNINSTALLED until they notice  get a fix. Until then I'll go back to my AccuWeather
