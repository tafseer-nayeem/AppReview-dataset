SERIOUSLY I've played this game before on other tablets and phones and works fine. But my Ares 8 does not work with it. I bought it, start the game up and chose the first level and then closes the game on me by itself. Uninstalling
I cant open it The app will open but i cant start playing.I know this is a great game from the lite version but for 5 stars pls fix immeadiately
 U know why does shadow fight 2 work but not vector It just keeps crashing 
What the full feature  I've download the normal vector last year . Today i purchased a full version of vector . But they are same as normal vector version 
Why it keeps downloading content over and over again When it reached 99200,it goes back to 0200. And now I cant play.
Pay to play You pay for the game then you have to play levels over and over to get stars to unlock the next level or you can buy coins, its exactly the same as the normal vector just get that its the same no difference, if ypou didn't guess there is also adds in it.
Crashes Yes and it doesn't bother to cross the splash screen anyway.
Remove the ad.. We paid for it.. Ad on the paid app Is a big NO NO..
ADS why this game still have ads I buy thia game with money
Can't detect touch When I try to jump this genius just goes away sliding. And he just suddenly slows down and falls down Logic
Won't let me exit I don't call the developer at 3 a.m. in the morning, why does the game have to remind me to play at 3 a.m. in morning What a jerk When someone exits the game, they should exit the game. You don't need to remind us to play, especially at 3 a.m. the morning. Other than that it's a great game
Not good After install always dwnload 1 to 200
