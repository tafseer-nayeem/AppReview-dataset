Does not work The screen shows a logo and plays some horrible music but does not load. Uninstalled
Background music is annoying so we won't be using this app until there is a way to turn it off, or music is removed altogether.
Needs a lot of improvement
I don't want ads on a toddler's app even if it is the lite version.  Also the app is unreliable. Either it won't start or it suddenly stops.
Bad one Very irritating app..... poor picture.... loud music...... my son dont like it
Not so gud Background music is horrible and main sound is very low
What a useless app Background music wont let my son or me hear a thing, if i could give 0 stars or 5 i would
My son was using this every day but all of a sudden it stopped working and sayss I don't have the correct hardware with a black screen
Awful The music really is WAY too loud. Difficult to get out of when it enters full screen mode. Uninstalled in less than 3 minutes.
Background  music is to loud.
Exclient Good
Well organized but too noisy to hear anything, who approved it anyway
Back ground music is unnecessary makes the app pointless
Doesn't work I have downloaded multiple times and all it does is flash a black screen the whole time. So frustrating because it looks like it would be a good learning app.
Stopped working My daughter loves this game but it stopped working She loved the crazy music, the animals, sounds and pictures. I've uninstalled and reinstalled a few times but it still isnt working. Please fix asap
Doesn't work As soon as i opened it. It flashed back and forh between screens over and over.
Not much kinda like it
