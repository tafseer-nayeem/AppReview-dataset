Can't do much without spending more and more for the extra apps you need to spend a lot of money to get anything like the screen shots on here looks like I'm going to have to bin it

It updated and stole midi sequencing limiting us to 45 seconds. That's a violation of the original sales contract as you have removed a benefit post my fulfilling of the obligation to pay.
