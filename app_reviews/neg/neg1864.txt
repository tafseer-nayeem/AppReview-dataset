Frustrating I find it frustrating that so many of the bad guys can hit you on extreme angles, but your attacks are limited in direction. Also being bounced off of a bat, into spikes, then again down a pit  is incredibly sucky. Game looks great, just more of a pain in the butt than fun.
game save feature doesn't work I reached almost to end of game. I did signin to Play too. Now , I changed my phone and after installing the game and signin, the game progress did not sync. This is very very disappointing
