Crash always I use to like this but cant play it anymore because Crash every time when i try dev New game
Not much features I paid for this thing hoping the full version would be hella fun, but no. It's hella boring. After 20 years, you're done and there's really nothing to do in it.
Great game, but...... This game ran flawlessly on my note 2, but on my new note 4 the game tanks hard in performance. Frame drops all over the place and occasional freezing. Great game for anyone not on a note 4.  Update A new update came out and it still runs like crap. If your on a newer phone you may want to avoid this game altogether.
Lags a lot The game slows down a lot I tried changing quality to performance yet the game goes very slow fps wise just randomly on my older smartphone galaxy s3 it worked much better but for my new one plus one it goes horrendously slow.  I've seen others complaining about the same thing.  Until this is fixed would not recommend buying this game.
Why so laggy Used to play this game all the time in the past and it was fine. But now playing it on my Samsung galaxy s5 it lags. It's on performance. I even uninstalled and retarded my phone but nothing 
Amazing game but slow When I had it on my iPhone it was rapid, it didn't stutter or slow down. On my android phone its painfully slow, it stutters and the game speed settings don't work. Fix this and its 5 star
I've had this game before on my HTC Sensation 4G and I loved it. I decides to get it again after a few years away from it and, on a new phone Note 4, it is laggy almost to point of being unplayable, even with preferences set to performance. I want to enjoy this game again, but until the performance issues are fixed I have to set this at 2 stars.
Cant get to the third office I played the demo and I really enjoyed it but when I bought the full version I played for hours and I never got to the third office and I'm on year 18
