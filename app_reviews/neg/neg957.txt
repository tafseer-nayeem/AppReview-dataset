There has to be better Notifications don't go away, there's no white list
Doesn't stop the caller from leaving a voicemail. I put my trust and money into this program and it stops text messages and the calls from actually ringing but it doesn't prevent them from leaving a voicemail, so hopefully this review helps someone else in my shoes.
Worst When someone calling it gives two ring before busy tone so they think we are cutting calls
Please Fix I have it set to block all numbers except the ones in my contact list but random people are still able to call me
Update Has stopped working for no apparent reason. AGAIN.
Support sucks...even for paid PRO version Blocking by begins with does not work. Blocked calls go to voice mail.
Schedule , someday is not working. Block  still  active out of time schedule. Please fix
I purchased the pro version, and it didn't work at all Calls continue to come through. Refund please
Bought this app and it says something like  license verification failed please check your connection. Kindly fix this problem. Tested the free version and I get 2 rings before the call gets blocked...i think it's better if the call gets blocked instantly. I already sent mail to the author of this app and only got one response.
Hmm Why would i pay for another pro
Not working right Calls on my blacklist are still coming in and are not being blocked as suggested. Why is that
It rings twice before hang up.  Urgently fix this.  Your support don't respond on my emails.  Please advise why.
