Wrong wind It tells wrong wind speed many times
So many Times show wrong wind and weather
Sucked
One major flaw Good information, however,  the map itself doesn't show wind direction. I'd think that would be priority 1 on a wind app.
Terrible
No wind direction arrows on the map All kinds of info about wind, etc. There is even a map tab. Soooo, what is the map for if there are no wind direction arrows over it Please project wind direction arrows over the map. ZZzzzzz This is a wind app right   In reply to Windfinder Direction arrows on the map should give the direction of the wind.  If you want an example then look at the other windapp...WindAlert.
