Never able to load Fix the bug and take a 5 star.......I have 654 friends who play this game and I told them to give a 2 star cause it doesnt load ...I'm giving time till tomm to fix the bug
black screen everytime i go into the game all it will have is the audio but no game
Not a big fan of all the force stops Game was fun the 10 minutes it worked. .and the constant crashes are a pain.
Really bad The game is simply unplayable. An ad after every single action is a little bit overboard and the game lacks any real content...
How the hell do you get 4,4 stars stupid game with poor graphics and control hole game makes no sense at all
Uhg I really use to love the game but now I can't even get on with out it crashing every time

Doesn't work I can't get into the car.
Way too many adds Constant crashes and wayyyyy TOO MANY ADDS this game just overall sucks.
Heapsss of adsss Good game but there is tooo much ads
Piece of shit Sucks at every level coz won't open .crap game as well as developers
Its ok Wouldn't be so bad if when you unlock other bits to it it freezes then u ave to reinstall it
wow never seen so many ads. wth is wrong with devs. if you are so poor don't make a game I guess, geez.
To many ads driving me nuts I know its a free game and you have ads. But this is to much . un installing now.
