Freeze's I buy the 99 cent one and it freezes when I talk to a farmer you can see every thing else moving in the background but I can't press anything to move ahead
Purchased prime Gemma not credited I purchased three IAP items prime Gemma worth 3.99, 0.99, 0.99. Only 100 was credited to my account and 600500100 is still missing.. IAP purchases processing in this game is so pathetic.. Refund my amount
Stole my money I paid for gems and used them to buy an alt summon. Phone force closed during purchase, and when I reloaded, the gems were gone but I didn't have a new creo. I've been robbed. If you're a cash player, AVOID THIS GAME.
Good game but I lost my save data wen I try to send it to the cloud and its not in the cloud.... now I have to start over again
Crashes constantly I just got the game and already it's crashed 16 times. I need to constantly save just so I don't lose my save file. I am using the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge. Fix it.
Can't sign in with g Title says it all... Please fix as I'm not willing to send more money on a game I had to pay for to play already which I can't connect via g. Im using  a Samsung galaxy s5 on android 5.0
To much freezing... Sorry devs but the game freezes wayyyy to much like the concept of the game but just way to buggy.... and for the fact when you freeze and you didnt save b4 you freeze you lose all present progress....                                                       now when i get into battles i either A Vs a NPC and freezes the game or B my Player VS's an enemy and freezes the game....
