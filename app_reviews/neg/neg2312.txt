Jaii Must be more responsive Delay is horrible, it must be more responsive or people will stip using it, in my opinion. It's a good app, so that we can play it directly connected to the speaker
Very bad ..don't download it It's a nice try to bring harmonium on android... But unfortunately not successful
Not good app I think this unity all apps are bad. Perfect piano is the best app. You can not find any more bad app than this app.

Not bad App badhiya hai . Lekin app open hone ke baad back hone ka koi option maujud nahi hai . Isliye ise ekdam achha nahi kaha ja sakta hai .
Locked up my phone Could not use my phone screen stopped w I rking could not turn my phone off and app never worked
I want a good update Slow, OK sound, worst handling, just uninstall it. Wait, don't install it
Harmonium Apps not working When I run this app, max times with in 2 sec, message appears Harmonium free app stopped. Its hangs when 23 stings pressed and I have to force close this apps. Kindly do changes, so that this app can work properly.
Don't want to give a single star.. Third class app
