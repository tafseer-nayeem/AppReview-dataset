Incorrect letter names A few fixes are needed to this program. Letters should not overlap the pictures as it makes it difficult to hear the letter name or the pictured word, letters should give the sound used in given word, letters that team up to make one sound should be grouped together such as sh for ship, if using letter names at least say the right letter p is not pronounced bee.
Debby Why I like this game because is helps me know all my spellings and that's good of me
Pointless This app is terrible. If your child does not ALREADY know how to spell, you'll have to help them with this. A LOT.
When there are 2 flowers the word comes as floers but when  worm is there it comes as worms. No singular plural...
Hated it I didn't still using it,that's why i download it then I play it its duper nice
Spelling for children You spelled disc wrong it is disc not disk but other than that the game is really good
