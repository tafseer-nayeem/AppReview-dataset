Opens up somewhat fast, but not very effective. It takes some time to load the song I am searcing for and STILL does not find the song. It works 35 times yes, it has been tested.
Needs More Classical. Of all the themes from major symphonies that I have tried singing to it, only Beethoven's fifth has been correctly identified. This makes me think that it wouldn't be particularly useful if I was trying to identify something that I didn't already know.
NEEDS, A  UPDATE Hi, can you do a,  update, so I and other people can use these,  select all, cut, copy, paste Thanks,                                       If you do the update I will then give you 4 or 5 
Can't find any of my songs Search for songs or artists and get something not even close to what I'm looking for. I'll keep it for a couple of days to see if it's user error otherwise I'm dumping it 
This sucks I can't find any of the songs I want. Super slow at loading. Don't recommend this app
