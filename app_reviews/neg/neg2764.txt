Very good, but Not for kids. You have to supervise because of ads. If ads were removed, 45. Touch could be made easier for under 2s. My 21mth daughter is very good at it now. She did have trouble with getting blocks to snap to space, and also with ads. But she has mastered both now. She closes ads straight away. Good lesson for her
Ad's ruin it. I can't imagine why anyone would ruin this game with ads that trick a child into clicking them. Such a disgrace. Why not even charge to remove ads. Really disgraceful behavior from the Dev.
Adds are a big problem Its really a awesome game. But the fact that there are so many apps is absolutely crap. How does a 2 year old know not to go in there. Really guys. Rethink.
Only worked one time Opened it and it only worked one time. The next level it when u put the shape where it belongs it won't work and keeps making the ding sound.
Ads in a baby's game My daughter enjoyed this game till I saw it has ads in the middle. How ridiculous to have ads that a baby would obviously click on. Uninstalling straight away.
Should get harder after each acompishment to many ads pop up and my little sister keep pressing them every 5 minutes
Pop up ads make it useless game would be great if you could pay to remove the ads. My 2 year old keeps touching them and the I have to fix it.
Game Mode Good game but it really needs a proper gamefull screen mode so toddlers don't hit homebackapp switch
The adds The adds the pop ups. .the rating pop up. .I hate them. .please do something to fix it. .I had rated it a 5. .and I still kept getting the rating pop up. .there for I significantly dropped the rating.
Baby wooden blocks I hate it but my baby brother love's it.
