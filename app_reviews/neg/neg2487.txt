Boring It'd be better if u could customize ur own look n stuff but till then I'm giving it a 2 star
Boring All you do is just talk with them and then go on one date and that's it DONT GET IT
Soooo boring It's just need more in action to feel enjoy the game..I like it but I'm bored
 It froze an didn't Un froze when I just got the game so I installed it 
It's pretty boring I got through all of them all in less than an hour, nd there's no point 2 it just answer questions 2 them, nd tht's it
Ehh It would be better but there's ads covering half of the screen...
