Super Bad Everything is bad from texture to controls of game... It seems 'ROAD RASH' the bike game i used to play in 1998 was better than this game... 
Annoying popups destroying fun This game is good however the repeated popup adverts and rate this app etc. make it a truly annoying experience, I get it you want money but an advert every 5 seconds
Lost my progress  I had for 1 month and  I I got on today and lost my progress  don't  waste your time
Dislike it It is junk it is not as fun as it looks and the cool cars don't even look like cars
Ads I'm not going to watch an add everytime I complete a level. P.S. you guys don't know cars for applesauce.
It's Good... But make more levels. . .
Not dad but not even ok Tomenny adds and it really suks
Bakvas game It's the most  boring game ever  and does not entertain us to the level we exepted as when I looked at the pictures which were describing the game I thought it would be fun         BUT IT'S DAMN BORING
