Helps learn but has ANNOYING FAULT The starting indicator on the chalkboard gives away some symbols, but the main issue is if you don't have a symbol directly center of the board or you're off too much,  it says incorrect when you do write the correct symbol.   Only on hiragana but I have a feeling the same issue will happen in the others.  Would give 5 stars if the app would recognize the correct symbol as opposed to a shape directly in the spot it wants.
