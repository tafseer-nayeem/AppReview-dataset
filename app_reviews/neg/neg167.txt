Only giving one star cause it keeps closing the app or saying there's a problem with the Internet connection when that is not the issue I liked this app it was helpful but haven't been able to use it at all please fix
Not letting me log in uninstalled and reinstalled and still cannot sign in now I'm just going to uninstall permanently and go through the regular website this is bs
Still unable to login even after update I haven't been able to login to this at all since I installed it. I keep getting a warning message that Terms  Conditions couldn't be loaded and to try again later. So far this app is totally useless to me. Still waiting for a fix...
Problem connecting Everytime I try to.use this app, it keeps saying can't find secure connection I've even tried.over mobile network only
Won't keep payment info Part is the point of this app is to look at bills and make payments. It will not store your credit card info, do every bull you have to enter it again. That's just stupid. Most of the app works okay otherwise. It does crash often, especially when trying to paste in info
Application will not allow me to log in. There is an error preventing me from logging in. Its says terms and conditions cannot be loaded at this time. Please help,
Doesn't always work
