Couldn't remove simple rectangle without messing up the photo
.. I dont like this app..my pic look not realistic plz refund my money back...this app scattered my pic
Stopped working and developer hasn't responded I've emailed and received no response as to why the application keeps shutting down saying it has stopped working after a full restore, reinstall, cache clear, etc. It worked fine til recently and if they get it working again soon, I'll upgrade my rating. But I'm looking for a replacement app since right now this one is nothing but dead garbage.
Use to work great but now it messes up the photo and leaves red boxes in photos
Not impressed with the working..... Works  nice only  with   clear background
Free a year ago A year ago I downloaded this app in my galaxy s4 for free, and I still have it in the phone, now I got this new galaxy s6 and it cost 1.99 I think i shouldn't have to pay for it now, if I have downloaded it before with the same account in a different phone. Don't get me wrong, I like the app, just that is not fair to those that have downloaded the app a long time ago for free.
This app does not work as described This app does not work as described, I tired it with several photos and got the same result, once object is removed it will be blurry and the picture will look messy.  Most good reviews were on an older version. I am hoping that they will update this app and make it work better   I do not recommend it
