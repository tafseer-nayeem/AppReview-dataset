I restarted the game glitch I restarted the game wanting to get coins quicker with the 50 more option before I restarted it I had already bought it. But playing in the new one I've lost it and I'm not allowed to purchase it again pls fix this or give me my money back. Or I will file a law suit for fraud and scamming.
Could have been good. Its a good game,  good graphics, but there are some really irritating things that really spoil the fun, hence i am uninstalling it. The enemy kills the hero in about 3 strokes, its annoying having to collect a huge amount of money to build up armour and power, crystals are rare, it saves automatically,  so if u had a bad go you can't restart with the same resources.  Its too difficult to progress unless you of course pay for the coins and crystal.
 Its really hard to download sepron file even if im using good network connection
