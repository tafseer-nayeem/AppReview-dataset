Not great for  introducing letters This is better suited for kids who have a sound knowledge of phonic sounds.  In schools we focus on teaching lower case letters first and then move on to capitals.  This game uses both at the same time and one of the games makes words with just capitals
Rubbish This was rubbish didn't teach my child  anything I would never recommend this app to anyone
Very bad application No button for existing
can't leave easily.
About it Nice good app I loved it
Waste You only get half of it for free Not helpful
Alphabet Only having a few letters before asking you to pay for the remaining alphabet.
Not working It is just playing upto H not playing more alphabets I am uninstalling it
No good Toddler can easily close out of the app. It doesn't lock
