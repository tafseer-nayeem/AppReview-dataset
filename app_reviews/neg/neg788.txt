Inaccurate Data The App says that there is no load shedding scheduled for today In the JHB CBD, I am however without power as we speak.
If only they put as much work into the app as the  name... Consistently inaccurate. Even when it gets the forecasts right it doesn't warn you when your area is about to be shedded. Don't be charmed by the clever name, this app is almost as useless as Eskom itself.
Incorrect info No load shedding in Weavind Park but app says stage 1 has been implemented
Load shedding right now in my area  Constantia park, but the app says  no load shedding My wife has grid watch and she got an sms
This app says no loadshedding for us, guess what power is off. Never showed my area anyway. Thanx for allowing this guys
Useless with wrong info Really rubbish. Gives warnings when there is NO load shedding, or at other times just inaccurate. Don't waste your time with this crap.
Great idea, terrible execution. Hangs, doesn't update, crashes... Terrible execution of what could have been an excellent app.
Bad taste Die naam se baie van Maritz en Wells se waardes. Al was die app goed en dit is nie kan niemand wat ek ken dit gebruik nie. Dis net onaanvaarbaar en gross.
Wrong info Ferndale Jhb according to app stage 2 on 26 July from 1600. It is now 1350 and the power is off. WTF
Good app Good app but takes forever to update... Frustrating. I think developers that build a good app but don't interact with their customers regarding issues are not very bright.
Sooo slow Every time I open it. It takes forever to load Quite informative though.
