Poor quality and full ads Video quality is poor n ads r irritating so much. Please fix this soon or i hv to uninstall it
Can't even uninstall it WTF It sucked so I wanted to uninstall it. When I dragged it to uninstall the app logo on a white background popped up and it won't let me uninstall it I'm going to report this developer UPDATE Finally found a way to uninstall it, had to go in Google play store to uninstall This all is complete BS and is basically malware DO NOT GET
