Very good, but... After testing a few comic readers on the play store, I decided that this is the one, so I bought a copy to remove the ad. However, now the application crashes every time I delete a book. What gives I'll return with 5 stars when the developer fixes this annoying bug
Failed to acquire license. It may be the best reader out there, but it's worthless when I can't actually use it since there's no radio in my WiFi only tablet.
Ugh.. Failed to acquire license....wtf man..I paid for this
