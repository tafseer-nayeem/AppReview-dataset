Got suspended I got suspended becasue they rated the seller and I wanted to exchange and the seller was willing then all the studen didn't so I disputed with my credit card company to get my money back this app is a bad app do not buy they suck they don't have no phone number to contact just email scam alert
Bad. You will loose all your money There is no customer service number to call a lot of people are cheated out of their money please go to their Facebook page to see all the comments and complaints people have
Scams the buyers They don't check their tracking. The seller can print the shipping label and not send the item. Mercadi will side with the seller and blame the buyer. They will not refund if shipping label was made and item never shipped They will always say check postal service. Dangerous loophole that mercadi allows for scammers.
I hated this app I was so jerked around on shipping and I prerated a seller my first purchase. She never sent my stuff so I was just out 35 I would not ever use this app again
Lps It does not let me log in
