Don't download It's wouldnt let me download the game and it stole my money. Due to an error. I want a refund. Beware it won't even download
Bad cliches Ok it's good at the start but it has way too many cliches,  the characters keep cliching and you can't see nothing on the race it goes black and I can't see where I'm going also I can't select which cup race because it's just a black screen so fix it please my kids hate it because it's cliching...fix fix fix or I'm unstalling not worth the money if it's going to be like this.
