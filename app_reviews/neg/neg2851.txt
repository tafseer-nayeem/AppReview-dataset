Nasty watermark  type of deception It looks a good app and we'll done to the developers. However, there are other good video editors out there that do a decent job without putting a watermark on the video. I would suggest the devs think about removing the mark and use some other means of generating revenue. Encourage users to contribute rather than blemish the video. Many app users make contributions to innovative devs without any form of blackmail. I am one of them. Good luck.
It was amazing But not any more You have to pay for parts of it but you didnt used to have to do that
Water Mark ... is like a BIG UGLY ZIT  Stands out way too much  SMALLER, MORE OPACITY,  POSITIONABLE, ... BETTER YET,  How about a small credit AFTER THE MOVIE.
