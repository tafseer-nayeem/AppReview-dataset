Another key Stage 8 level 81 the key is at the bottom of the box and yet again it won't allow me to move any further. Please don't make me have to replay the whole game. I'm not happy standing still or staying in a backward position. So agitated
Ok I give up, I an on stage 14 level  39 more dots not changing color. You can't move on if they don't.  I love this game but I quit.
