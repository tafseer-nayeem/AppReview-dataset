I badly want this to work.. but the focusing dial is not working.. no matter how much I turn it.. focus is not changing.. I'm using Sony xperia z3  Update... xperia just released camera AOSP.. can you add the Z3 to your development Please
Manual Camra Zro Totally wasted my time on Nexus 5 could not autorotate while watching my pics, and app crashed a few times with no reason. Why can't I get back my money Play Store changed.
Decent with some trade off Nexus 5x, exposure not working, and shutter only can set to 15 which its no idea for night scenes.
Ok when it works I'm on a nexus 6 device and the app is constantly freezing. It's extremely frustrating as I want to take a picture at that time and it will not open up again. I have contacted the developers and waited over a week before leaving this negative review. Cannot recommend this app.
Problem with manual focus Nexus 5, cannot manually focus to infinity. Probably Android 6 has different threshold
Still not support for RAW in Galaxy S6 The latest software update for Galaxy S6 since 5.1.1 support the new API for camera for thirdparty apps, but by now Manual Camera not support RAW on my SGS6 Generates 0 bytes DNG file. Is not my device because tried AzCamera and Camera FV5 and they both supported RAW with the same software update. Bought but noticed this after refund time, so I'll wait if this bugs are fixed or definetly move to FV5.
