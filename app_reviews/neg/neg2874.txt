Where is the recents button I am not sure what button that is.too much time tryimg to figure out things when it should be easy....i paid for this smh
Great App, but.... I just purchased the Pro Version and I love it. It does exactly what i want it to do. However, on my tablet there is no way to access the menu. I dont have access to half the functions I cant save or share. I have an LG 10.1 tablet. Better rating when i can actually use the app fully....bummer.
Cannot save or share on Note 3. Crap app. Avoid this one until it's been developed properly.
Interface needs work How do you access the menus on a Note 4 Can't find em Interface is a little clunky  needs an undo but that let's you go back a few clicks. Ok, going to go look for the menus again...
None of the options shown are available. Won't give me a refund after 1min of installing the app.
Can't save your work How do you save anything you do
The most lame application but i still buy it.. Worst UI, confusing, lazy developer, but...the app still workin'...
Can't Save on Samsung  Galaxy  S 5  Active What up with trying to save , menu just closes the app
Piece of crap Can't save on galaxy5 fix this crap app
Very slow This app is super slow on my Nexus 6. Please refund me
Cannot work with Android 5 Lollipop does not have menu key, essential to use the app menu.
Share function missing from the menu Accessed the menu from the recents button but the share option is missing.
Unable to find Menu with Oneplus one It really Doesn't work with a Oneplus one.
Garbage Don't waste your time downloading. Only part of the menu items even show up and is overall uneasy to use.
Problems it won't restart
