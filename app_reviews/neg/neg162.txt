What Have You Done Suddenly the whole app has changed. Why do I have to leave the tree to add people to it What's worse, when I go to the family page, there's no reference on the page to who's family I'm working on. I used to love this app. It wasn't broken. Why couldn't you leave it alone
Historic insights How do I prevent the Historic Insights from appearing on my tree... Not wanted  also adding hints no longer works....
Installed OK on my tablet.I can see the Tree but am unable to initiate a new search
I've only been able to enter what I know which I've had to Google first then enter. And it won't even let me get back to the section where I can enter names  birth dates to hopefully find a little something. Help I know this isn't just a website to enter what I know.
Not free Yes thats right. ..per the settings menu and your account preferences. ..you have access to manual tree building but it does not allow you to search their records for family members.....total bullshit....uninstalled.
Need to be able to select collection Really don't want to wade through over 1000 USA marriages for someone who lived and died in the UK.
Duplication You can't merger duplicate files or person's.  Also can't see other members trees
