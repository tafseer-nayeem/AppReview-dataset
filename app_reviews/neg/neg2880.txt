Why. This is a pretty fun way to kill time but it's crashing far too frequently. I need it fixed or I want a refund. I can't even play it for more than 3 minutes at a time because it keeps crashing. I've sent numerous crash reports but I'm not seeing any improvements.
It won't stay up the moment I start drawing it crashes or closes itself its really fun and I would like to have it but won't keep it unless its fixed
Bugs Needs Fixing Please fix the bugs when I get on and click a element it shuts off and says unfortunately, sand premium has stopped. Every time , please fix the bug
Awesome game Love the game, great way to kill a lot of down time. Its be cool if there was a speed up game time button, and then if we could have a bigger play space. But still 5 stars all the way.
