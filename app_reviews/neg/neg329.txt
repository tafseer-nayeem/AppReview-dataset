What Happened I was level 13 and was in the middle of a dozen quests when suddenly I am being told to make my character and I am at the beginning again with nothing to show for months of hard work. It was a great game until that and I can't recover my original account. This game is rubbish now.
I can't play I use to just have a glitch where my characters were just white blocks. But now the game won't even open. I have uninstalled and reinstalled many times but I still can't get the game to start up
Does not open I have played this game before on a previous device. I tried downloading it to my phone, it opens the app than once it gets to 100 loaded, it kicks me out. I try deleting the app and redownloading, I tried reloading the app. Please, if you can fix this problem that would be great, possibly fix with an update
That I'll Give you 2 Rings if you Watch the Ad I always watch some ads so that I could get 2 Rings but that thing doesn't work I have 248 Rings and I watch the ad but then it didn't give me my 2 free Rings I should have 250 Rings by now It didn't give me the 2 free Rings even if I watch the ad repeatedly And I also couldn't connect to my google account and I even tried connecting it on my Facebook account but none of them works
