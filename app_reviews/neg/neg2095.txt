FIX THE BUGS Today I beat level 119 finally. But in the end when I beat it the game kept going. So I turned my phone off to end the game. And I did not advance. I am still stuck on 114 when I beat it. This,happened before. Please fix
Sucked So many glitches Carrot characters broken, fruit moving issues, unbelievably annoying sounds and animation. Not worth it
Keeps crashing, haven't even had the opportunity to start the game.
Fix Ever time I beat a level it bots me off.
The rabbits wont leave after you make their juice. The touch sensitivity isnt that great and sometimes i have to swipe 4 or 5 times just to move 1 fruit. Love the game but those rabbits need to leave when they get their juice
Rabbits Rabbits on Level 11 won't budge... Even after I fill their glass. Any suggestions Might be a glitch... Other than that the game seems fun.
Juice jam Rabbits are staying when their order is finished and causing me to lose the game
Crashes on Motorola Droid M
