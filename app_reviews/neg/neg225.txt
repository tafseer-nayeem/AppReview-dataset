Last Few Updates Suck Still having problems with it opening. Missed out on getting tickets for 2 games now cause it wouldn't open the app. Don't want to lose faith on this app cause it was great all last season.  FIX IT AND I'LL GIVE MORE STARS 
App is broken I've already tried to reinstall it. With any result, the app stops immediately after I click on the icon. I'm using a one plus one
App turns black.
Unhappy I had to get a new phone and re downloaded the app. It won't let me log in. I've tried with a password or Facebook. Neither works. I have also tried clicking forgot password but it doesn't do anything when I click on it. Very frustrating. The first tickets I wanted to purchase are gone. Who knows how long the other ones will last.
Unhappy Why does it force your to buy 2 tickets, sometimes I want to go to a game alone and I don't want to be forced to make a purchase of 2 tickets.
