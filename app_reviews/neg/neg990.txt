Too many bugs This app rarely works and has a small data base. The camera doesn't like to focus, and I can rarely get it to actually take a picture. Also, I get more we can't find this item than actual results. I would have deleted it a long time ago and used good, oldfashioned Google search if I hadn't actually paid for this app
Problems I love the idea of the app, but I wish it recommended the alternatives instead of having to find a group that possibly might be the right one....also now I just get an error message when I'm trying to look at the alternatives
Account dont work Cant set an account. I use Facebook and it says its expired log back in still expired. Try and use my email it says account already exists forgot password no account exist.......
Well I can't get the scanner to work at all  But there is a section  that tells you what companies are cruelty free and not cruelty free. I can't do much without the scanner so I hope this gets fixed ASAP but it has the promise of a good app
Difficulty getting it to work...
