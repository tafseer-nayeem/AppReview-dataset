Not working properly Suggestions while typing gets disappeard for English as well as regional language.And next word prediction is not working too..     facing same problem after recent update
New update circulated today is useless. I am quitting. Do not take away the liberty of typing in English fonts those get converted into Marathi
No gesture typing. App is good only for those who have a habit of typing with both their thumbs. No option of gesture typing which is a must these days.
earlier keyboard was better I liked the earlier one. It was good as with a flick I could capitalise alphabet of any word. However now flick up types a capital alphabet but doesn't include it in the word making a feature useless
