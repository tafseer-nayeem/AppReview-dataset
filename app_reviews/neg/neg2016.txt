Games are rigged When I play snakes and ladders, it always keeps me finishing last and making the game longer than it has to be.
dice games biased does not allow you to throw two consecutive sixes, although the odds are 136, this NEVER happens.
Board Games Snakes etc etc is too small.  Move the dice and fill the screen.
Really bad Its a free game and it needs to have ads, I understand that ... But do you really need to be exposed to advertisement 100 during your play time If the ads could pop up from time to time and then dissapear that would be much better. People who made this didn't care about the players one bit. Why should we care about their game
Not fun Don't count on winning. Slanted in favor of computer player. Multiple double rolls, can't get ahead until computer players win first. Crap app in my opinion
Awesome game I give it an A.
Used to love Now it response is slow and seems like there are a lot of touch issues
Screw this This game is sht.
