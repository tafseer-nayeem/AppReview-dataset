I've purchased it but it doesnt work . everytime I open it, it says, Patatap has stopped WHY
Does not work The app only open and go to a black screen or a loading page that does not ever load
I can't get it to work on my lg g2 Black screen
Not working on Samsung Galaxy SIII I can't try it, so for now, just two stars.
So laggy as to be useless as anything other than a toy. Shame, not worth paying for when the free desktop version works so much better
