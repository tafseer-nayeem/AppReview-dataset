Quotes no longer realtime Not sure what's happened during the last  batch of updates but the quotes no longer reflect the live price.  The price does not match it's own graph. Seems other users are seeing this too Emailed support twice,  no response. Big thumbs down.  Shame as it was my go too app
Crash when enlarge chart .
Awfull It crashes when you expand the chart. It does not update at all. Freezes when just opened. I want a full refund
Not real time Quotes don't seem to be in real time, which is the main reason I paid for the upgrade
