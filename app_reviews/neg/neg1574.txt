Sucks i cant even refresh going to uninstall dont waste  on this garbage app
Won't bring keyboard up to login I have had this on my tablet for awhile now and I just got a new device that I downloaded this app on right away. However I am unable to even log in because the keyboard won't pop up when I'm in the username  password boxes. I've waiting several minutes in case of lag, reclicked the text boxes back and forth but no keyboard.
It can be better with more features Where are the blockers The colors of following and not following are similar.
Doesn't work anymore The free one works but not this, irony.
Something's wrong... I can't refresh my page I can't ask for help its not working. Nobody new has yet to follow me Why isn't this working
Limit to unfollowing changed Why is the limit changed from unfollowing 100 people to only 20 now
Broken. It used to work great, but now it works like a welfare lifer, not at all.
Token bs Can't reload now even after signing out
I won't me log in But I can log in with my regular IG account Wtf
Horrible The App Keeps Saying Error And Wont Let Me View Any Of My Followers Needs To Be Fixed
Hate it, hate it  I cant even enter, it says log out then retry. Help 
Not worthing
It's not accurate, I feel like I hot ripped off I used the free version which is MORE THAN SUFFICIENT but then I wanted to clean up some of my ghost followers so I paid for this app, BIG MISTAKE It's not accurate and it only looks at about 100 users. If I could get my money back I would.
Very upset. I was using this app all the time but now it won't let me unfollow more than 20 ppl  fix please and I'll give it 5 stars It use to be amazing
