Wtf is going on  The 2nd level gets frozen and you can't get out of the car .
Very bad... It is just a fool game,it is nice for first level then it doesn't work.It just stop working properly
Aw do I get out of d car in level two... I get stock in d car
Suck This game suck you cant shoot do nothong but drive
I hate it So so so so so so so so bad game
Idk what to say I'm sure that this took much work to make but it needs more traffic and walking mechanics. I think it also needs to step away from the businessman thing lol this is like no offence the original GTA IV Lost and Damned DLC before they even tested  it and it was just the first ever code of it. But it had potential I just think you can make it better and when you do I really think it'll be cool.
