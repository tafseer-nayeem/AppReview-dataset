Still slow, still has ads. Solo has been running slower and choking my phone with ads for ugly themes and bloatware. Only way to get rid of them is to download the apps and hide them. Very unproffesional. General speed and useability has declined too.
Bad Ok so I downloaded it but know I have everything big and zoomed in and I hate it, please help me, I think I'm going to cry and I don't want this on my phone. I tried uninstalling and installing it but nothing works  This app is bad for people that have android phones
Great before the New update After I do the solo boost, an ad now shows up every time. It never did that before. It's really annoying. I don't know of any other changes besides that
Not working on moto x play can't get to settings I funny understand why it's not working on my x play when I could have in my s4
