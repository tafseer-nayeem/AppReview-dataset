Android tablet Doesn't work on my daughters android tablet. Automatically closes out when it starts. Have uninstalled and downloaded again, nothing works.
Dis gam iznt gud I don liek diz game. It is dum. My mom let me git it. She mad me go 2 mi rum. Pepa is ugly.
No sound I can't hear Peppa or George so I can't get my 2 yr olds attention and she loves pepper pig..please fix so I can reinstall after the bug
Uninstalling... Buggy My 2 yr old loves it but it works 1 of every 4 Times we use it on my HTC phone
Dont work When I put it on it sent me back to app store again and again.
Constantly Crashes This App constantly crashes with a black screen since the last update. Currently unusable.
Doesn't load then goes off Don't waste ur time in downloading this app. Downloaded it for my son and it won't load and crashes have done it several times and still the same.
Android tablet Regularly had issues. If it actually opened then it would let my daughter play for 2 or 3 minutes and then stop working. My daughter loves Peppa and always wanted to use this app but it never worked properly.
Won't load. App opens, loading 'paintbrush' comes up then app closes and returns to home screen. Tried repeatedly with the same result.
No way to censor genitals. It keeps letting my son draw genitals.
