Boring Lame. Stupid. Horrible.  Unloved.  What's the point In having the app
Hate it Needs to hurry up and load the keys.
Keys I feel like you are not listening to your people because I too agree need to earn more them one key a day or have a way to earn more besides watching videos to get them
Not good I used it for five minutes and then it won't let me back on and the pages are so short. Also I think that they should let you go on the app more than once a day. Needs some improvement.
If you like a game you only play for fifteen seconds every twenty four hours,  go for it.  The entries are short. You get a limited amount of free keys which doesn't regenerate except for the 1 free key you get every twenty four hours.  Ain't nobody got time for dat.
Wasted 10 bucks This game is super cute and fun. It was so addicting that I couldn't wait for keys. So i paid 9.99 and come to find out i only had 2 parts left. Please tell me there's a part 2 Or new stories. If not I demand a refund.
