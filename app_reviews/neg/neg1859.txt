The Ads are the worst In addition to needing friends that actually play the game subsided slightly by the alternative friend search method, it constantly, CONSTANTLY pops up Ads for other games Zynga wasn't this forceful, and Zynga was very forceful. I quit playing Zynga games because it shovels the other identical games down your throat. I enjoy the game, but the constant bombardment is about to make me quit.
Definitely an entertaining way to pass the time Having LOTS of force closing issues...VERY disappointed. Lowered rating to one star because I get no help n would appreciate a refund of at least part of what I've spent. I cant play this game now and the maker is saying its my device which has more unused then used memory and I HAVE force stopped the app with ZERO improvement . STILL NO SOLUTION AND WHAT A WASTE OF MUCH MONEY.
Fun but annoying The push ads were bad, and the fact i need swords well it was a hassle being i have to download other games to earn them. Sad too because it was fun besides thess issues.
I will no longer play any rockyou games I havent had a problem with the game till i spent a few dollars on the deal u recently had and now my game wont even run at all.this is the second rockyou game that this has happened. It did this to skull island as well
I don't get it I planted a lot of corn and couldn't see. What's the point of this game anyway There is a lot of stuff popping in my face and makes me mad. Uninstalled
Deleted because it forces you to sign up for rock you community and I have no desire to do that. Get rid of the objective to sign up and it would probably be a decent game
