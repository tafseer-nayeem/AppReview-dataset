Major flaw I bought the pro version both for ipad and android. Same table settings give different strategy map. You wouldn't know which to learn and even if you pick one, the other plarform would be useless.  Very disappointing.
Terrible. Most 0.99 trainers do what this one does. I was expecting a more comprehensive program or at least some extrapolation in the hands played. The hand play selections for how you want to play your hand are oddly placed. This is a simple 'initial play' trainer, you can find better for a dollar or less. I have one I paid 1.99 for that I am happy with. Good luck at the tables everyone 
Fun But not right. Take a look for your self folks. But not matter win or lose the house always wins. Setting at 300300 the house wins and you lose 301300. You win and the house wins 301301. I have watched it for a while now and it no matter what always gives the house a win. Don't buy folks its almost seems like a  scheme.
Cant see strategy table as you play only after you deal You could a lot quicker if you could see the table before the deal instead og guessing
