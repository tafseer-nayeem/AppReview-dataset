I'm sure it's a great game Can't even play on shield tv 
Originally game it 4 stars for lack of Android TV support, now giving it 2 because it force closes every time on my Shield TV.
Facebook required for leaderboards  Not only that every time I finish a level I feel like I'm being prompted to log into Facebook with its dirty big logo filling half my screen. Why anyone thought that was a good idea is beyond me...I can play the exact same game on steam using steam leaderboards.
Crashing on my galaxy note 5 Won't even play. Played on my s6.  I really miss this game
Control's I have the S6 edge. Game runs great except for the controls.. They work great for 1015 sec into the game then the right stick just stops, then it just going off an auto fire mode and fires at random enemies vs what's closest. Please fix... Unplayable.
Won't get past load screen I was so excited about this game. Don't know what to do. Want to play
