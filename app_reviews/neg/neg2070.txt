This app suck And I don't like things that SUCK like this app.
Completed 2 things for free coins. Only got the prize for completing 1. Still fun
Crashes The game crashes all the time. When I go to the gun wall, you could scroll left to find guns to buy. Also new guns. But now there's nothing. Very disappointed
Does NOT work for Galaxy S6 Edge. Once you boot up the app and get into the loading screen, that's all it does. You can tap on the screen after awhile and it'll act like it's on the main screen, but it's not showing anything except for a glitched loading screen. Not happy cause I wanted to have some fun with this app again on my new phone but now I can't 
Piece of s This game freezes on the loading screen but the game  works in the background but you can't see what it's doing
I LOVE THIS BUT lag I used to be able to play for like an hour then suddenly now when I play I go for like 30 seconds and than BOOM lag like crazy lag its unplayable now
Little problem Hey, for some reason have no idea if this is just for my device... but the loading screen won't go away I REALLY want to play this game. Please fix this bug... please. '
Ruined Ads after each gun ruined it, I loved it to death, now it's complete rekt with ads, paid money for all the guns, now I request a refund
