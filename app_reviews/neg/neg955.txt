Great concept Wish this browser worked better. Unfortunately, you can't zoom in more than one time, because the screen goes blank until you zoom out making the browser useless.
Crashes alot Could be 5 star if it wasnt laggy, choppy and didn't crash all the time. Also the menu bar gets in the way. Please remove the mouse amd keyboard off the screen.
what happen  use to be able to play a youtube video while browsing the web on another tab...but not anymore
server problem it always shows that the app needs to reconnect to server, reinstalled it couple times but still can not solve the problem.
Slow It slow lose connection a lot on good full strength signal. Messing up typing a lot like  ahayy when typing happy
Terrible Puffin will not work yet it says its compatible with my device and my internet connection is fine.
Don't waste you time with this get NAKED BROWSER best there is
Laggy and a lot of crashes Would have been 5 stars if not crashing the whole time and very lagging if you have more as 3 windows open. I use to only use this app on IPad, just got new tablet and bought this version, wish I didn't Hope you will repair it soon...
