Link Local doesn't work I've been trying to trade pokemon on Pokemon Silver on this app. It is being met by a ton of errors. I paid money for the upgraded version and might get a refund. Please fix this
Pokefail I try to trade pokemon on two deferent phones from gold and silver version's and thay pair up go in trading room and it tells me I have to have both gold and silver version on each phone  fix for 5 stars
Doesn't work I loved it at first now all of a sudden it shuts off on me and won't turn back on at all. Every time I open it it force closes. Until then it was great now it's just a waste of money since I can no longer use it. Fix this or refund my money please
Connections issues I love the emulator but I can't connect with friends through WiFi or Bluetooth... Connection error after 2 min on Pokemon TCG 2..... But other Pokemon games work fine... Edit. Also playing Pokemon TCG 2, it utilizes the infrared port.. Is that not emulated yet
Rip off I was happy with the free version, but I wanted to catch all the pokemon so I paid for this app. However everytime I try to connect to my other device the link disconects. You also can't trade between games, like redblueyellow. Only between say blueblue or yellowyellow. Complete waste of time and money.
Could be better Cant connect pokemon blue or red with pokemon yellow this is a big problem the only reason i got the app....its now a waste of time highly disappointed i expected better from this app how sad and pathetic
Not able to connect to other Pokmon games Will not let me connect with my friend who is playing Pokmon Blue when I'm playing Pokmon Yellow. I PAID MONEY FOR THIS This should easily allow us to battle and trade with each other. They are practically the same game RIP OFF
Lost in the sauce I dont know how to download games so i could use this app. Can someone help please
Good but Its not reading the roms I download. I didn't pay 4 dollars for an GBA GB GBC emulator that doesn't play games I download.
