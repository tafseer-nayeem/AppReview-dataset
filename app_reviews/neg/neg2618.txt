The game has one massive issue being that it does not open. Keeps coming up with an error message and then closing down. Losing your progress everytime. Needs to be fixed
Rubbish This is the biggest pile of puerile rubbish I have ever had the misfortune of buying.  Its ok if you are 2 years old and have the brains of a rocking horse.
