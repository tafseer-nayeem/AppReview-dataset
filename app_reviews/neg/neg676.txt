Missing feature of saved drafts On the web version, I have saved drafts which I use while sending an interest. However on mobile app, I can't find any option where I can use drafts while sending an interest. All I can see is an option to send a message. It's not possible to write long messages on each sent interest. Drafts are very useful.  For me, it's a useless app as I can't send interests without messages. And I am a life time paid member.
