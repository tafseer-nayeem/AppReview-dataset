LOSING MONEY BIG TIME Busy day in Winston, high point and Greensboro area but my app kept closing down and when I tried to get back on it cannot detect my location.  I got one rider all day  FIX IT UBER
GPS locator needs to be fixed ASAP Get rid of the lower pop ups and why is zoomed in so much. I can be 5 min from a surge and not even know it. WHY NO TIPPING
Needs more info accurate  gps partner apps would help, tip option needed immediately
Better, but still needs work A tip option for passengers is needed. They ask for it all the time.
Why all the updates Why do I need to update this app everyday Why do you keep screwing up your app that you have to fix it everyday
Update needed The most recent update makes it nearly impossible to accept a ride. I repeatedly got error 403 forbidden. Please fix this in the next update. I will not be driving until this is fixed.
Hate the new bottom popup. Its the last thing you need while driving, more unnecessary stuff to obscure your map
No tips  no stars What do you care if a customer tips a diver You are still earning the same about. Screw you
Try to sign in and app says partner not active. Help
Freezes and freezes and freezes I'm not sure why you touted the new app that proudly It has nothing useful On the other hand, it freezes pretty frequently The last trips don't show on the app So disappointing
