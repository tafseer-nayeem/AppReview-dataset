.Sorry, how do you set this up
Nice looking app, but... It looks nice, the weather is roughly accurate, but the time is stuck at 1018. I delete the widget, reapply it, the time is right for a while, then, back to 1018 P.M. For a clock that doesn't need winding, it needs winding.
Keeps freezing. Times always off.
Stops all the time and freezes up
Very poor apps
it's TC apply downloads,  installs. opens  says this is not an app.  install another app to work. why not mention in description then... 'v'
was heisst falsche widget grsse. fummel schon halbe stunde rum.  mfg
