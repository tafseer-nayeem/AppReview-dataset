Skipping... I actually really like the app. I had White Noise Lite for a couple of years and because I liked it so much I just recently purchased the full version. The full version, however, does not work as well. The sound skips constantly and keeps me awake now instead of helping me sleep. I'm rather irritated that I spent any amount of money on it just for it to not work properly.
Very poor data management The app plays default sounds nicely, but it fails to export user created sounds, and it ultimately deletes recorded sounds. I asked for help via the app, but never got a reply. I regret spending money on this app, and I advise you stick with the free version. You will not be able to utilize the pro features, so it's money wasted.
Core product is good, support is very poor. There is a problem with downloading new sounds as the developer forces you to login using facebook which I don't have or Google, but their system doesn't work if you use Google 2 stage authentication. So if that's you're situation be aware that you will not be able to add any new sounds from their market web site or app and will receive no support despite paying for the app.
Great App, But I use the function to have the sound automatically turn off at a certain time every day. However, the app keeps running in the background. You have to close it manually, otherwise it eats up your battery.
Love the sounds but only plays in one headphone. I cannula all other music in my headphones but this only plays on one side. Very odd. I played with the settings and tried to adjust but it doesn't help
