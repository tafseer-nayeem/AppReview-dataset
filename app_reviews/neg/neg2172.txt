Not worth the money. This game felt like a beta, of a demo. I was expecting some kind of open world evolution type game... It's just another wannabe flappybird. If it was free I'd give it 3 stars.
help right after I launched the game, a shark popped out of my phone and bit my parents, very dangerous game
Waste I could have coded this game in an hour and im a high schooler. If you make a game like this, make it free
Bad to worse The control scheme is TERRIBLE Just looking at at makes you go ugh I can't believe I wasted a dollar on this trash.
Blurry on nexus 5 . can't accurately follow movement. Refunded
Horrible. Terrible, not like any growing fish game I've ever played. Don't waste your money. I would get a refund if it wasn't such a pain.
Worse Than Flappy Bird TURN DOWN THE SPEED AND SMOOTH THE ANIMATION OUT
Dont Buy it It sucks As in Wtf this game should be free  Wtf wtf
Dont buy it controll is wrong even when u touch the tail u die
It needs doxing It starts of to fast it should start of slow and it's hard to eat a bigger shark is always beside it
Bad Nope don't pay
Waste of money
Waste of money
Horrible
Great idea Just much too fast it seems like its in a fast forward mode otherwise I'd keep it but unless its slowed down I'm getting a refund
Lame Tap to swim up, tap to swim down. More like a 25 cent game.
