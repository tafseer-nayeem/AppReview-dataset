Doesn't Work With Google Play Music Dear developer, why do you state explicitly inside the app after I've purchased it that your app isn't compatible with Google Play Music, yet this fact isn't mentioned anywhere in your lenghty app description For those hoping to use their streaming music service with this app, save your money, it won't work with this app.
Doesn't work with Spotify Like a lot of people, i use a subscription service for my music.  I don't have any music downloaded on my phone.  I do have music downloaded for offline use through Spotify.  This app won't let you listen to that.  I can't speak for how well the app works.  I am sure it's great but I won't be using it unless I can hear music during the gaps of the story.
Great idea but it really needs the option to use an external music player like their other app, zombies run.
Doing good Distance units are all messed up. Ran a 5k and the app says I ran 7.5k. Repeatedly off. Resets preferences like shuffle mode for music. Doesn't pot down music enough to hear characters speaking. Now the horrid website is in development. Crap.
Buggy For 1 year now I always got the message unfortunately the app has stopped working  whenever I wanted to start a mission. I wrote several messages to the developers but they don't seem to care. It's just that I paid for this and it just doesn't work, well it does until I actually want to play a mission.
Music or story You can only pick one. This app would be great fun, but it's drowned out by even the quietest music, which means you have to pause your tunes to hear anything. I have to use my phone's music player rather than the internal one, because for some reason the app would only let me pick one album These guys need to fix the audio levels and track selection  the story's worth nothing if you can't hear it.
