Convenient banning means no corporate payouts I liked this app at one point. It was fun to collect kicks and have it seem like I was on my way to a reward. Now that I have enough kicks to get that 25 reward, I am suddenly banned for supposedly scanning barcodes off the internet, which I have never done. I already have issued formal complaints to the BBB and FTC about how big a fraud this company is. If you actually want real rewards, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. It is a waste of time and battery.
Frustrating I used to like this app. Now every time I try to scan items in the store its telling me I have to be in the store, huh. I contacted customer service twice who assured me that the problem is my phone settings for location. I can get kicks for walkins but not for scans. I'll keep it just to keep up with the advertised deals.
Always freezes This app does not live up to expectations   Always freezes when big kicks are involved 50 or more  for walkins.  Will often freeze when you are in the store scanning items.  Not worth the effort to get a small sum 5 gift card
I referred someone and installed the app for them off my link and it said they signed up with someone else and never gave me kicks for their items
It keeps saying Houston, we hit a pothole. The thing is that I'm not in Houston
Pothole For like the last week everytime I open the app it says they hit a pothole. Please fix this.
We hit a pothole Unable to use the app after it working OK for weeks. Just says we hit a pothole and to try back later. Also walkins not working lately and problems stating that I'm not in the store scanning when I am.
