Beautiful but won't work for me Certain events just won't stay in the calendar. This is apparently because of sync issues on my phone that I have not been able to work out after a month of trying. Support attempted to help but much of the suggested steps didn't match the options on my phone and responses to emails have been sporadic at best. If you don't have the issues I have it is a great app.
The app is crashing When I select the widget calendar on my home page the screen goes gray and crash. My phone is oneplus 2, pls help.
Best calendar design out there but using it is harder and harder. Restless What's new dialogs bothering you all the time, always enabling Google Birthdays Calendar even though you set it not to sync again and again, not respecting Always use this option, asking again and again what app should open the event, settings icon permanently visible in the widget even if turned off in the Settings, wtf 
A pop up ad Are you fing kidding Pop up ad when trying to schedule an appt. Unbelievable. Uninstall. And I had the paid app.
Was a great app, not so much now. I've had no issues with this app until recently. Loved it, in fact. Now it won't save the entries I put into it, so it's almost useless I'm very frustrated, and as a long time satisfied PAID user, I'd like this fixed as soon as possible. I see also that I'm not alone in this issue.
Help Not Syncing Even after I hit refresh, it won't sync without a long delay. Please help
Best Looking Calendar The only feature this doesn't have is custom event frequency, which is coming as I am told. The new Holo Dark theme is amazing
No value You buy this key and they still want a subscription fee for more.
This is a nice looking app, it just needs the ability to put tasks in the week view. I will rate this app 5 stars once this change has been made.
