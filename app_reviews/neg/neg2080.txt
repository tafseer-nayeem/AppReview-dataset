Decent at best The fact is that it's a typical match 3 puzzle game with an interesting development interface  misrepresenting it as an adventure  or dungeon Crawler  is forgivable,  but charging 3 bucks years after release is crappy
Frustrating For years, gamers have been conditioned to abide by one simple rule when playing a match three or more style puzzler move one tile to match three or more. One tile. This game however breaks that fundimental rule and decides to make you move entire rows to match your tiles, thus making this potentially enjoyable experience a frustrating brain ache. A real shame as there are some great ideas here.
Way too hard I bought this game because  of the good reviews it had. I was very disappointed.  The game is too hard. I never reach the end of the second room. It is badly designed. Having to look to match stuffs in the grid and look at the same time in the scroll And on a time limit is too much to ask. Also the game really on the very old,  doll,  match three things together concept.  unimaginative. Could be a start if they make the timer optional. In this case I would add a second star.
Crashes upon opening Please help Game looks so fun and i purchased it, but every time i try to open it, the game immediately crashes
Nope I hate this game, especially the developers who constantly ignored my emails about a refund that I really wanted due to glitches. I would not recommend this game to anyone.
Not worth money Bought the game...beat it in 3 days.  It's fun but doesn't last long.  Buildings only upgrade once or twice and free play is pointless once you beat it.
