I would have gave it 5 stars 1It's impossible to get past night 2 because balloon boy keeps getting in my office 2 the animation for bonnie is gone and that removes the creepiness of her 3 when you die you just sit for seconds and makes it look like you aren't dead
Eh I dont like this game right now because it just logs me out. Please update and I'll give you 5 stars
Crashes my game but still like people play the game and get jumpscared I start the game, I clicked New Game,Phone guy talks and I check the cameras I exit the cameras and all I do is the normal stuff you are supposed to do then it said 1 a.m I keep playing then when it is about to 2 a.m my game Crashes and I don't get to even play night 2 because it glitches and crashes my game if you can't play on android tell me Scott, WHY DOES IT CRASH ON ANDROID HTC
Give me a refund now I have begged mom to buy this and I gave her the money and I'm 15 years old and I have no money and it keeps kicking me out update it or refund me make a choice
Well, It just kept stopping on me while I was looking through the cameras. It would take me right back to home screen. Each time I tried playing it would give me only very little time. Then it would black out for a little bit, then take me straight to my home screen. . I have a DIGILAND Tablet.
This is point and click call of duty. Three released in one year and a fourth coming soon. ReallyReally Don't waste your cash,this game is complete crap
