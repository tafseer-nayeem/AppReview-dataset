Awesome until the Glitch My 5 yr old loves it, and it's awesome until.... she got stuck on lvl 3 in Easy mode. It will not allow us to place numbers in smallest to biggest order. We are on a Samsung Note 5, but after this she has completely lost interest. ... not a happy momma. I felt this was an amazing app to help her move along in class and in life. Please fix.
Cuts out The audio cuts out so the kids dont even know what they are supposed to do. Uninstalling.
Game The game is boring I dosen't  like
Kids math It is fun for kids
Adds wont allow my child to put in correct answer. Uninstall waste of time
My son loved it until normal level 4. It doesn't work and he can't progress without passing it.
Too many ads, my kid always accidentally clicks on them.
