Couldn't even start playing because it wanted to connect with my email account but every time I clicked on my email, it just sent me back to the same thing to do it all again. Run around. No thanks.
OMG Advertising Ruins Game Great game, but advertising appears after almost every level. It's unbelievable
FLOOD AFTER PAYMENT Please, start the next level on the app restart Please, maker startup faster. ATM we have got an age on startup. This is a reason I play this game very rare. Rate and Invite friends flood exists even after payment
Pay to play garbage If you mute the app, the auto play ads will still be as loud as they are programmed to be. I feel bad for the poor sap that made all of the great puzzles and had the overall  experience ruined by ads like this. Also, who are you guys kidding with the whole pay for hints garbage Freemium paytoplay is something to be ashamed of. And the developers that allowed for that should feel bad. Do not download and support this poor behavior. Do not download.
Gets old fast It's a nice concept, but there's SO much more that could be done with it that would make it more interesting. The puzzle designs start to feel redundant pretty quickly, and although it's still a decent challenge, it eventually ceased to be an enjoyable one, at least for me. Good if you like monotonous puzzles, otherwise not really worth the time.
So many ads Constant interruption from ads, some if which are videos with audio that you can't skip. Constantly nagging to rate or invite friends. Not worth it
Good game. Well made. Ruined by the accountants. Levels are so easy they're boring,  unless you pay, and the ads are far from subtle.
