After downloading, you cannot play continiously because you need to downloading the full version
Very bad
Just wants money Nice job adding the pay money buttons immediately after the song plays, every time.
Uses up too much space on my phone Could be more educational and fun for the amount of space it uses...
thanks for selling my 2yrs a song wiyh a ctedit oayment. no setting which allow u to disable this nice
