Not Working USB Device or partition type is not supported by solid explorer. It's just a standard sd card reader and ES file explorer supports it just fine. Hopefully future updates will increase support proper OTG is the only thing missing from this otherwise perfect app. UPDATE Unfortunately, its still not working despite recent updates. Happy to provide more information if it would help.
