Getting a download error So until I can actually play this game on my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 I'll unfortunately be rating this 1  as it installs on my phone when I open it and it tries to download the rest of the files it states I may not have purchased the game which I clearly did Also this problem is happening on icewind dale as well I also emailed support and have yet to receive any contact from them for going on 2 days now
Will not install After the 6g  download game displays a screen locating resources 00 mb  and never advances. Total loss of money...
Update give black screen After most recent update,  black screen,  no background.  Chars on on a black background.  Please fix
Force close Report sent, no refund option.
Finally fixed 112 Black screen since lollipop
OMG EVERYONE IS GONE I finally got the update to install, I finally got my tablet cleaned up enough to update this game AND NOW EVERYONE IS GONE All of my master mages, my theif that was so good he stole Sarovak's armor before I fought him. They are now all gone months and months of work down the drain........I am thoroughly depressed right now. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because this is still a great game....but oh god how I loath it right now.
