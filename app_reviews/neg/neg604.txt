If there wasn't the music.... The music is what you might call inadequate or simply silly, the game is total unrealistic and shows only traces of fun. It's not even near a real air traffic control.
Initial music volume non responsive initially. I love this game but when I start app, the music starts playing invariably at FULL volume and there is nothing I can do to shut it up for around 10 seconds. Volume buttons only control ringtone Off button doesn't silence it Eventually volume buttons start controlling video and media. Really irritates people around me. Music shouldn't start until game play begins. Please please please fix this musical  boobie trap Uninstalled until then.  HTC M9.
Ok Use to be a big fan. Until they put no effort into bringing out new runways  customization for runways. Also the wind sock doesnt work properly..
Good game but buggy I can't drag from the top of my screen when a plane appears as in this game the top cm of my screen appears to be ignored. This is a great game and always was but on this phone it's buggy as all hell 
Bored in 5 minutes
Badly optimised I've foun that on my galaxy note 3 this game looks very streched and controls horribly because of this. 
Doesn't work right on my phone The planes are in slow motion on my Galaxy S4 Mini.  Even when I up the speed lower left corner, it is way too slow.  It worked fine on my previous Android phone, IPhone, IPad etc.  But for some reason, it doesn't work right on this phone  and the fast forward button has no effect.  It is SO slow that it is almost worthless.  Does anyone else have this issue
