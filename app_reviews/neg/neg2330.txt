It's good I am not sure if this app is bad for you  but I like it and its not my problem but I hope you like it cause I do
Unbelievable Apps are meant to improve with updates. This one was amazing to begin with and has been in my phone for God knows how long. Now I'm actually considering uninstalling it. Until the last update, I would've rated 5 stars.
Can't play After updated, I can't pick the string as fast as before. Please fix it sorry for my english
Sounds gross Ew, doesn't sound like any good guitar I know.
Ugh The older one is better its so laggy and its late. When you press a string it will make a sound 2 sec later pls fix
Terrible This app will not let me play the guitar and its not just this app, its the drums, too
Doesn't work... Good concept... No audio. Doesn't work on my Note4 or GS6e
Ruined update The update just ruined an amazing app.....please fix it....i would have rated it in negative if it was an option
Goodbye  This app was great until the latest update. Now it is unusable so I am uninstalling it.
Wow I got what I wanted Big Five stars
Not a real guitar. I installed this app in hopes to get a free REAL guitar, but was dissapointed to see that my phone did not morph into one.  Also, while testing out the app, I was hit by a car and died.  Very dissapointed.
Closes I can't even open the app.
Uninstall this update Let me say from hero to zero Can' t say any words
