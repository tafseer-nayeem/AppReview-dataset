Needs work Crashes a lot and will not work when I have my WiFi on. All other apps work and internet, but this app will not for some reason. Took about 20 tries just to login  installing and reinstalling uninstalling and reinstalling 5 times then finally got it when I turned WiFi off. Probably will not get much use if this does not get fixed
Annoyed Can't disable notifications unless you go into Android App settings. Can't set a radius of how far to see catches. I don't need to see bass being caught in other states. When you click on a lake, and the map comes up, you can't zoom out on the area. You have no idea where that area is even at. Could be a good free app eventually but not right now  never for  40
Keeps crashing I used to love this app now it just wont work keeps crashing so i uninstalled and reinstalled hoping that'd fix it now its absolutely useless i cant even login anymore. Ugh.
Pro version.... It is a very nice app but misleading when you load it by telling you to invite 10 people and you can get the pro version. After doing it you get the message that the pro version is only valid for 7 days. Why not tell it before you invite the 10 people Therefore the one star. Felt like I sent spam sms to my friends to invite them.
Issues Can't unfriend, can't set the locations, can't move map, can't click on a location and then click on directions because direction icon is right on followers icon. When you click direction, followers opens up. Video above says use our Apple app, Android app and website...website only shows apps for android and apple
Tried to add my first fish last night which happens to be a new state record it's been in the upload process 9 hrs now on my phone I have latest updated version on Galaxy s6 active.
notifications it needs an option to turn off notifications, or if it has one I haven't found it yet...
