Timetables are wrong The times indicated in the app are consistently out by 45 minutes  meaning you miss trains. You can't rely on the app, they haven't bothered to update the schedules. Also, the widgets don't work, shows the same station for departure and arrival. Used to work and be accurate, but not for the last 4 months. Poor.
Doesnt wprk Never works correctly. Even when climbing onto a bus it never shows true location. As useful as every other crap service in RSA. Thanks for taking up my data.....POS.
Schedule is out of date Schedule has been out of dates for two weeks Bad...
Painfull. Inaccurate departure times. Slow to update bus positions. No refresh button.
