Very limited on the number of clouds that supports. Does not support any of the club vendors that support encryption and it doesn't import encryption itself and as such is a unsecure application for storing your files. It wants five dollars for something that most programs will do for free of this nature. Furthermore it always supports three cloud vendors as of this time. It needs a lot of work for five dollars.
App went down the drain This app sucks for 5.X tried to use it on 5.1 states I need to connect to pc. I connect. Then the PC program says helium is enabled and the phone itself never connects just loops saying to turn on ptp. Doesn't do anything anymore.
This app ruined my phone. I can't even back up an app it keeps typing passwords without me touching my phone. Don't buy this app and save your money because it is not worth it. I have the note 3 running on kitkat just fyi
Dislike it Not bad, but unreliable with large groups of apps Titanium Backup is better for that, can't edit app selection for scheduled backups, doesn't run when screen is locked i.e. schedules are virtually useless, scheduled backup jobs often don't run at all, poor folder naming and location in Google Drive, doesn't work with some apps e.g. Temple Run, and, according to Clean Master, autostarts secretly after startup, consuming traffic and system resources.
Completely useless now. It used to work. It won't complete a backup to Dropbox, Google drive or SD card. Not much point if it won't complete a backup to Google or Dropbox. I've tried from different wifi networks and always the same result. I've tried 4G as well. I can't even back up a single app unless it's to a local SDcard.
Refund   I bought today, I want refund.. what is the purpose of buying this app without the capability to back up whatsapl, wechat, line.. big fail.. refund please
