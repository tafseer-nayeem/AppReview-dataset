Won't work on Galaxy S3  Serious problems entering letters Game does not allow you to enter multiple letters. Requires you to back out each time you want to enter a letter. I can't afford to upgrade to a Galaxy S4 or higher just for this game. Before this problem occurred I used to love this game.
Good game... But 1 star for cheating on hints...I installed and checked trivago app but got nothing... That's ridiculous.... Installing app for the same... You cheaters
Logo quiz Great game. Buy so many pop up ads I stopped playing and deleted the app.
