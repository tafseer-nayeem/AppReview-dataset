I don't understand... Why make you turn your phone to match the map up with the way you are walking to get the arrow to point in the right direction It should automatically calculate no matter how I'm holding my phone.
Rubbish don't bother Does not work unless you have a perfect unobstructed parking site,  ie not under cover or near a tall   building.  Also gives you an option to change from feet to metres,  but just ignores your preference and does ft,  obviously for the us market and everyone else be dammed.
Nope It didn't help me. My little dog knew exactly where my car was. I own a Galaxy Note 3.
