Not working I love to play this game on my Samsung note 3 but after I switched to Samsung note 5, it's no longer working. Pls fix it, otherwise will uninstall after 2 days. Thanks
Mildly fun...not worth the ads though Game play has no diagonal shooting limiting the strategic part of the game. Commercial between games.
if only it had bluetooth multiplayer... It'll be the best game.. in my opinion.
Not running The game doesn't even start on note 5. Gives error please fix.
Too many ads... With these many  ads... thus game is worthless.
Crash Game won't start. As I open the aap it forces shutdown. I have Dell Venue 7
Sosa If only I can play with someone else
     
No exit button There is no exit button..
