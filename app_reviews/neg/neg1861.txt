I wish you could login as a returning player I have finished about 16 to 20 islands. I do not want to have to start over. Please fix this.
I'M SO MAD IT ATTEMPT TO BE GOD
It keeps crashing
WHAT What I don't want to start a new character I can only export the outfit Please fix, since my other player completed 3 islands, it would help Then I'll give you 5  s. I uninstalled because the game won't even show the guy in the blimp, just a black screen
This could be better. When importing my character, I couldn't access any of my outfits I bought and earned from when I played on pc. Plus I have to beat ALL of the islands I beat on pc. That's fustrating how I have to beat all those levels that took me ages AGAIN that I beat a long time ago and now have to go back and rebeat them all. Please fix this.
Ruined my life. OK so I installed this game about a couple of weeks ago and it worked fine for those couple of weeks. Now, every time I open the app and press RETURNING PLAYER it freezes before I can press one of my characters. This always happens even after I restart my phone or wait for a period of time. I really hope you guys will fix these bugs because I really enjoy playing this game.
Its could use a few more islands like Big Nate island or Dairy of a Wimpy Kid island. And whats with the music I like the way it was before. And it won't let me buy anything at the store. I don't really know how much money I have to customiz my character
Most rubbished game ever just wouldn't load and when it did load after a few sec it crashed
