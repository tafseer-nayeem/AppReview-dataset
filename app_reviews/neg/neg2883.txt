Not good Dont download this....In this app so many instruments I can see but only 1 or 2 are working..
I can't play any other instrument except for the xylophone and saxophone YOUR APP IS PITIFUL
Does not work on Samsung Galaxy Edge
In app purchases Constantly helping to get him back to instruments because of onscreen areas pushing in app purchases that get pushed

Kid loves it. But most of the instruments are lock. Sucks
I paid for the full app and only like 3 instruments load all the way...others work but dont show the instruments

Waste of time Only asking money
Whack
Not all instrument free Bad
Boring and not interesting
Hated it Hate it coz only two instrument can be played Uninstall
My sister loves this app but it only has one instrument unlocked please unlock all the instruments and I will rate it five stars. And put any lock button so that my sister presses any button it doesn't exit except the home button.  THANK YOU.
It is a gyp. You get only ONE instrument. One, that is all. The other instruments you have to pay for. Not worth it, especially since the title says instruments implying more than one instrument is accessible.
