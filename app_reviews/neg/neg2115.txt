Buggy The buttons are not responsive you click on just the ones that fit advertisements interest fix this and I'll change my rating otherwise a really good game.
Very bad glitches Im sad its glitches n freezes
it sucks I rotate my screen and the game rotates the other side...
Too many ads Suddenly the ads is coming when play the game...how come,,so disturb
30 sec video ads and orientation problems Loved this game until the last update.  Now the developer inserts 30 second video ads plus an ad that interrupts the game and 'fails' the turn if you don't watch a video. In addition the update creates issues with screen orientation.
You play just fine till it freezes up goes really small and cant even finish a real game needs to be fixed
Could be very interesting if certain bug issues  fixed. Freezes up mid way.
