Gyroscope Bug When calibrated, North is accurate when the phone is held flat But when held into position of a planet located to the South, it shows that the position is East which is inaccurate . This also happens when moved to other locations and gives incorrect information. Please Fix for Galaxy S6.
Camera upside down Nexus 5x
Failed on both Samsung devices. Note 4 Compass did not function. On the Samsung Tablet the camera view was sideway. Would like a refund.
Skyview on Note 3 The menu button simply does not work. Do not purchase this if you have a Note 3. Too late for me to get a refund.
Not cool Loved the app when i had an iPhone but now i have an android and it is not working properly. Please fix bug
Used to love it Now app is broken. Everytime I try to zoom in and identify something, it skips to a whole other location.  Loved it when it was bug free
No longer functional for me Screen does not move to allow me to explore, but instead is constantly frozen on one area. This has gone on for a long time. Haven't used the app in forever as a result. Like others have stated, app used to be great Now seems useless.
