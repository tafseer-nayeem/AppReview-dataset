DATA MINING It wants to collect data on how you use your device. If you click no, it shows you a bunch of adds and then won't start. No explanation that saying yes is required to play, or what exactly they will collect from your phone, but you have to give access to your phone list and calendar. JUST SAY NO AND DON'T INSTALL
Crap This is a piece of crap I thought it was good but when I download the game and play it it's say's unfortunately zombie crush has stopped..
Booooringgg Why cant you move around like in cod or something i mean really it takes so long to get the guns and crap and to reload
Would be good Good concept of a basic zombie game but to many ads done ruined the game get rid of the ads and ill give the game another shot
Too much. Can't play the game for all the damned ads that keep popping up in the middle of waves.
Worst game ever This game needs more development to improve not just graphics. Also fluidity on movements of the characters.
