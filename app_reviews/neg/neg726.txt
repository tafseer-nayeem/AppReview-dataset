Card read failure Cant get snapscan to accept my card, and it tells me its a credit card when its not. Sort this out please snapscan team, i want to use your product
Doesn't work on Xperia J Probably more scanner issues. Never succeeds in reading the QR code. Tried at two stores. Gave up.
Keeps crashing on OTP Really concerning if the app crashes everytime I want to confirm my credit card with the OTP
Doesn't allow split bills Zapper works far better whereby I can pay a specified amount of the bill. Snapscan honestly is lacking in a huge way. Disappointing it has not yet been incorporated. Poor form
Installation  hangs I have the s6 edge and when I attempt to download the app it hangs with no installation. Is this an app problem or standard bank environment problem
App freezes after I register card Works well up until register
Won't sincronise Won't sinc my card on Huawei p7
It says that will send to me the email of confirmation, but it doesn't send. Very poor service
