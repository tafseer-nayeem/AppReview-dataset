DOWNLOAD GOLF FRONTIER ITS BETTER Developer BURIED my comment because his app is CRAP DOWNLOAD GOLF FRONTIER IT WORKS FLAWLESSLY FOR FREE This app doesnt have courses updated and gives wrong distance info. Galaxy Note 3
Great value Nothing wrong with this app. Great value.  No problem thus far. Update whilst never noticing before for some reason the yardage now seems to be out by c1015 yards. Not sure what has changed or why this is the case but very frustrating Have downgraded to 2 stars until fixed.
No scorecard or ability to add Gps seemed to work well but even though it had the course it did not have the scorecard or even the ability to add it so it wasn't very useful for using during the round.
This was cheap, yes. But also close to worthless Might be ok if you live in Florida, otherwise there are better alternatives.
