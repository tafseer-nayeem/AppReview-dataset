Wwe make this work Wwe you need to work this out when it tells you need a network connection and when I did and went to supsuper star I click on sting and all it showed was a 3 second black screen and went back to main menu. FIX IT PLEASE
Sucked It dosen't even edit the entrance you only do just pick a useless superstsr to make its own entrance
Horrible I cant evan use it because i have no wifi just internet. Please fix that or it will be deleted.
Sucks You just see them put there fists in the air it is the worst game I have ever seen
Terrible It should have more options to listen to Shaw the've got a few but not enogh.
Rubbish Keeps saying check your internet connection and wont work.Internet is fine.
No good Not the best thing WWE has made it needs some heavy work done to make it interesting
Dislike it Need alot more superstars and its just horrible wwe has the money fix the game
Sucked All you do is just pick some special effects and a background. The only thing that is good is superstars. Please edit or  please delete this app. PSIt sucks. PPS It's an insult to WWE.in my opinion.
Gay It won't ever work
Its no good it needs more superstar and needs more things like our own theme song
It won't let me use my mobile data It says I have to be connected to WiFi to use this and will not let me use my mobile unlimited data
Awful all you do is watch vid then write a name with fireworks
Sucks I just tap on superstar them stopped........working
Worst It will only show the wwe logo then won't work
Joux It says network error. Im unable 2 play it.
