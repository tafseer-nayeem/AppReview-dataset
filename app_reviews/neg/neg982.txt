Not working I bought it and it doesn't work on my HTC EVO 3D. When your phones screen fades after some time of inactivity, baby monitor stops to work. So it will let your baby cry forever. It happened on 3 different phones of my friends when I tried it so it's not rare problem. No official help provided. Finally I found workaround, you can put phone on charger and play with developer settings so screen never fades. I hate application which is not doing properly single thing it was programed for.
Unreliable It didn't call us even when the app was running despite my son crying. Wouldn't trust it. A baby monitor should ALWAYS work
Works most of the time Had this monitor for 8 months it works fantastically 99 times out of 100 but that 1 time it will turn it self off and leave no log. This type of product must work 100 of the time
Request data network I try to use it while in holiday but this app doesn't work without data network. If the price of the roaming is equal to a baby sitter....
Not licensed The purchased app frequently closes with falsepositive Not licensed message. Zero Stars.
