It took more than 30 minutes  to load this app is terrible
I borough up the app but it asked for a password that I didit know
no invader zim bye
Was working until newest update now it won't load spongebob and that's the only reason I have it. Also you need to make a nick jr. App
Was working SpongeBob was working until today now only the Yetti Krabs episode works.  That's the only reason I have this app is for SpongeBob.  Tried updating the app and uninstalling then reinstalling and nothing works.  Will give 5 stars once it's fixed.  Keep on keepin on lol
Total lame I tried to watch a full episode and u have to sign into your tv account by i don't have an account
We need a Nick Jr App I'm still to understand the reasoning as to why we still do not have a Nick Jr. App for Android.  We need to be able to watch Nick Jr on the go.  Nick whats the issue here the development team ought to be ashamed of themselves.
What's the point So far nothing has worked. Videos are either not available or simply don't load.
U can't watch crap the f pic won't show
Why Why do I have to sign in I don't have an account
Love it It let you see shows
Spongebob full episodes not working at all. Only reason I downloaded this app
The worst It wont let me do anything
Absolute waste of time Not one of the videos I tried was available to cast. Complete waste of time. Uninstalling.
The app freezes when I try to sign in.
So bad
Becux when I want it to work it don't it take about 15 min IT SUCKS
