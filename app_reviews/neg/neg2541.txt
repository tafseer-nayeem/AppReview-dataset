Why can't I play it anymore I really love this game But then when I tried to get on it it didn't work so I got on to Google Play and it said that I hadn't installed it. So I reinstalled and it said there was a n incompatible update. What happened I really want to play my game I was level 22
Hedgehog sim plz When i go in the water near the house you glich and go through the world and no animals are spawning so I'm starving to death thanks for helping
It won't let me on I really liked the description of the game, but when I tried to get on it, the screen would just go black and go back to my home screen
Hated it. Stays dark outside more then light outside. Game makes it act like the dogs are the birds lifeguard because I had not seen birds yet until dogs start chasing my cat then right away the bird is right on top of the head.  Also, how often do you see dogs running 2x faster then cats
