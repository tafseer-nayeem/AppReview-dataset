No alarm when on standby mode or when screen light is off. also some buttons are not functioning. sometimes hanging
Double payment upon reinstall.. The app started crashing after I uninstalled the free one. Tried to reinstall both and was double charged, lol.... To add to it, now the alarm is triggered no matter what, after the set delay. This app simply doesn't work.. Is a money rip.
BAD APP Save you data, money, and time. My cell do not take the pic, and send to my email when the alarm is actived on any time.  Motorola Atrix HD
