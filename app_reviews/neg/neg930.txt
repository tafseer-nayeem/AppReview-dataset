Beware it's inaccuracies The courses are community made, so not professionally checked. The first Japanese course I tried had multiple basic errors and no context explanations. Do not use as your primary learning source You can learn how to pronounced words, even if the meanings given aren't right, eg it says konnichiwa means hello, this is wrong
