Install issues. The game refuses to upgradeinstall on my Samsung Galaxy SIIx Hercules.  The only change from stock is an os bump, and it has upgraded since the pushout.  Otherwise I think the game is stellar, playing it on my Motorola Xoom WiFi.
This game gets 5 stars but... I bought riptide 2 and was never able to download it. The credit card was charged but I can't get the game..bullcrap
Crash Everytime after finishing the race, it crashed on my zenfone 2. I want a refund please
