Good games for the kids, but after buying 2nd time... MONEY SCAM Had to purchase twice for the same tablet. Also, despite same Google play account, I had to REPURCHASE for the replacement tablets when screens cracked.
Good concept but... Good concept but in the shape game it will show 4 options and sometimes 3 of the 4 are all the same but it will say 2 of those 3 are wrong. That is very confusing to kids.
Shouldn't be advertised as free... It is not free.
Had already paid for this. Had to reset my phone now I have to pay again. Really
