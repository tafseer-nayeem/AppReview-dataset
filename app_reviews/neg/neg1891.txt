Inconsistent Forecast is different than superforecast... could you specify what's the point of the one that is nowhere near to be accurate Whichever it is.... eg. 1012 knots at 7 and superforecast is 7 knots at the same hour and 1012 does not appear at all at that day.
What happened to my widget
Inaccurate forecast, infrequent updates Shows 10 mph, when the wind is clearly 1820. Yesterday's forecast was also off by a lot. The pro Forecast last updated 5 hours ago. Regular updated 15 hours ago. Pro doesn't match regular for the same hours. The regular seems slightly closer to reality.
