It wonts stop making my phone ring for notifications and forcing me to play or it won't stop
SCAM alert. After having this game installed for 1 day I was subscribed at 15 per month to some game site.  Unsubscribed and uninstall this SCAM.
Ads The ads make it hard to have fun. They keep messing you up and are annoying
