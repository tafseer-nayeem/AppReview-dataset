Not bad but not gud This game is great butt when you start the gamme firstly you collect all of the a only this iz the bad thing in this game otherwise its a Gus gm improve this game then I give you 5star
Annoying ad Kind of entertaining, but the plotembedded ad for magnetic woo bracelets kind of ruined it for me. Tony Stark would not approve.
An ad Yep their end is ruined by an advertisement built into the plot. Don't waste your time.
US propaganda Ok but still US propaganda. Free comics and kids stuff from political issues and hatred. It is a place to help take our minds off the reality and all those US wars.
Fucky people You are very fucky and you are cpmpanies I instal It when it 30.01MB it download return split on your brave
SPAM This is nothing more than a very sophisticated advertisement for some overpriced bracelets that falsely claim performance enhancing qualities. Save your storage space and buy a real comic.
Very bad 37.5 mb game finished within 10 min .i thought there is something amazing to play ..will control ironman in several mission but it is a comicbook.
