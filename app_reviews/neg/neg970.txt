App is relatively easy to use but doesn't transfer every single text in a thread which is useless when you need a complete record. The format of the exported texts is also really difficult to navigate and read.
Awful Sure it sends and prints texts, but only the first sentence of the text.  I received texts that were long, and threatening, but this app will not show more than the first line.  Waste of money.
Doesn't work on WhatsApp. Was suppose to work on what's app but doesn't.
Print text messages So far this app doesn't work that good at all.
Print text messages Not recommended.  Wouldn't even let me select text messages, said Mobile number not recognised Found free app, slightly more fiddly, but worked n did what I needed.
PrintText App I give zero stars This is highway robbery. This app does not work at all. It does not allow you to select a contact in order to copy and print them out. The program states there are no messages.
Bad Paid for it and it won't let me do anythin on it. Juss boots me out and said it stopped workin.
Bad Wont let me do anything keeps force closing. Do nt buy this app.

Robbo I'm a silly bugger  should have seen the previous reveiws, cause the programme doesnt work at all

Worthless Complete Trash
Don't waste your money. Consistently reverts by default to UK settings. Any attempt at functionality 2 options shuts it down. Multiple reports sent. EPIC FAILURE
Does not work. Purchased for work wish it did as described
It does not transfer all the texts like it says it will.
A waste It is even worst than before.
