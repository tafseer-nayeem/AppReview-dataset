Broken I paid 2.99 twice to renew my yearly subscription  it still will not open app. Please refund my 5.98
Should not expire. Should not keep me from entering app.
Password issue Suddenly I can't sign in. Am prompted for usernamepassword. Told I'm wrong. For fun, I say I forgot password. Am told email address doesn't exist. For more fun, go to create new account. Am told email address already exists. I paid for this app. Why can't I use it
Password What is going on Doesn't accept my password. Says my email doesn't exist. But when I register new, says both are already in use on an existing account Try 'forgot password' and that doesn't work. I PAID FOR THIS. MAKE IT WORK
can't  open Unable to open. Where is my password
Not finished When prompted to create an account, the app does not allow you to do so. Finish the app before you publish it Why can't I just use my Google info anyway My other apps have that option why should I have separate login info for each app Not worth the money
Found out it was a subscription when my school offers it already
