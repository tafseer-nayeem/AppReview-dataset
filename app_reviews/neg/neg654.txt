The game play isn't bad. Would rate better if the rewards showed up like it was supposed to, if the support staff was better, and if they gave me the supplies that I paid 50 for... If you play don't spend any money because you won't get what you buy and you won't get a refund
Point system sucks How the hell am I gonna play 12 games to earn points and the points I TRY to use to upgrade my player don't work anyway... It's some more paytowin bullshit
Dumb, horrible graphics Bloated, confusing, and features the most amateur graphics possible. UNINSTALLED. Try Perfect Inning if you want a real baseball game.
Upgrade After an apparent upgrade to the game, I lost all my points, stars, player stats, and purchased packages. Any help would be appreciated.
DO NOT DOWNLOAD, THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND HIVE ITSELF IS NO GOOD IN FACT I BELIEVE DANGEROUS THEY WONT EVEN ALLOW ME TO START A NEW ACCOUNT WHY WONT  CUSTOMER SERVICE SEND ME AN EMAIL SO I CAN RECOVER MY ACCOUNT
I have been active every day since getting this game but when I get on to collect my reward it starts me back over and I was so close to getting the platinum card needs to be fixed
