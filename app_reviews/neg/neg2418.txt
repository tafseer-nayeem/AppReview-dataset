I thought it will clean the system icons of uninstalled apps left over on screen were still there. Look like it just clean simple things like app data
Samsung Galaxy Mega 2 This is the lamest way to up grade to Pro version I have ever seen. Just write the Pro version and dump this lame addin. Get freaking real. Great app but this lame Pro add on needs to die. Would give 5 stars for the Pro.
Waste of money  time. I purchased the PRO. SMH It appeared to have removed duplicate files  photos but it only moved them to 1 filewhich CAN'T be completely deleted.
