I downloaded it. Nothing happens Each screen I came to nothing would happen after pushing on the list or other items. Wasted my money
VERY UPSET I just PD for this app since I loved the free one but all is does when I click on icon is stop. How do I get it to start without having to delete it and be charged to reinstall it AGAIN. HELP.
Nice toy but... It dosen't serve the purpose what so ever.
Crashes constantly
