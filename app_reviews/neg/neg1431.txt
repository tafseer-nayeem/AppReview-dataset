Don't waste your time Their customer service sucks. The app frequently doesn't recognize app completion so you don't get the credits and customer service never even responds.
Wow..... Just try JOY REWARDS App Using this referal d 1816147 and earned points.. you can use the points for any games specially The Clash of Clans...
Don't even want to give one star I download and do the offers but don't get my app nanas reward..i don't even get the daylay payout of 400 nannas..and now the app tells me i won't be getting my day lay payout because i don't do offers...worth less
