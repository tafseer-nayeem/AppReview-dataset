Paid app with ads Much of the plage of problems are now fixed. But still we have to endure ads in a paid app. Is this intended Nags to rate even after you have rated it. Nexus 5. I'm not logging an issue this is it fix your app.
Quit asking me to rate your app App does what it's supposed to. Minimal customization options though. App repeatedly asks you to rate it 5 stars which drives me crazy. It's also probably why is rated so high. You want an endorsement Here you go 1 star, your product is way over rated.
My Alarm Clock would be great... If it didn't SUCK my battery dry to the bone  It alarmed the first day I used it and then it didn't the following.  1 wasted.
It stopped going off shortly after using it I changed no settings that I know of and after a short time  it stopped going off ebtirely,  making me late multiple times  plz help ..
DO NOT PURCHASE I've given over a month to the support team to to address my issue or refund my money. Neither has been done. Horrible customer support and horrible application. Doesn't work as it should. If any other users are unhappy with these devs please flag this app from the very bottom of this page. Choose other and give a discription of how they have mistreated you.
No features...boring Don't care for the lack of color choice, how small snooze and cancel are....too basic for paying
