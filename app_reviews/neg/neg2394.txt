This Is a Mess The thing you will notice first of all when you start the game is that the GUI is a grotesque and confusing mess of images and information, very difficult to navigate. Then once you manage to navigate through this disgusting mess of a GUI you will immediately realise that you wasted your storage space on a game which looks like it was made in 1996. Is this a joke Are the developers trying to screw with us 210 police officer is pretty hot.
