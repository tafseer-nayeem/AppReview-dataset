Ads Really fun game but there's just too many ads. And 2.47 to get rid of them Yeah right make it more user friendly and less ads and I'll raise my rating
Horrible You can't win your team's shot sucks and the other team has no problem making it in and when you make a shot that looks like it will get in it goes strait through the hoop as a miss
Don't let's you even get points almost I had fun with the training pit the game you can't get ANY PONITS AT ALL FIX YOU GAME PEOPLE 
A few bad things about your game Your game is troll when your winning u can't make any shots in and when your losing u score also your opponents  can jump so fliping far your about to make a shot then out of nowhere a guy so far can suddenly  jump and block u please fix this you will get a better rate another thing when u block it suddenly  becomes a foul when I shoot it's not a foul. This is not about me hating it the game is good but try and sort out what I said
For An Older Version Make the stickmans a lot better than that. When that dunk you can see their hands.make them Ticker they look real skinny do it on football To.
This game ticks me off Don't waste ur time
Hackers Every time i play this game it goes black and then all the sudden the other teams win
