Fun My game suddenly kicked me from level152 or so back to level 29. Starting all over.  Lowering my rating to two stars until g5 starts saving progress on servers.            Old review  This is a super fun game. The only complaint I have is that it takes forfreakingever to recharge enough energy to play even one picture.  There are plenty of free powerups available, though, so that helps.
Lost game Have been playing for a while, today just had to start from beginning. Was a pro on most pictures. Will rerate once actual status is restored.
Enough with Halloween Considering deleting cos I'm so damned sick of all the Halloween stuff. Thought the challenge had finally finished...then it renews for another 10 days...wtf  Dropping down to 2 stars til you realize Halloween is long gone...and not even a significant event in some parts of the world
Installed the most recent update and now the game wont even open. Even after a previous bad experience i went and spent some more money on this game just to be disappointed again.   I used to LOVE this game but it's hard to move forward without purchasing stuff with real money. And i did purchase, like 20 worth and when my phone died and i bought a new one nothing transferred It wants me to start from scratch It's synched with FB so I don't understand I was so far I think I'll be uninstalling
