Hate it It takes too long...to open i spend my 15 minutes, and doesn't work...
Book is not there The book I want to read is Fairy Tail but it is not there how come
Very bad UX I cant search manga genre. I cant choose which chapter i want to read from a manga. This manga is like hi we have this list of manga. Please read what we have without know which chapter you read.
Lost some of good title. I'll give 5 stars if a lot of old title come back.
No Yuri manga I was trying to search in a Yuri magna I'm currently reading this app doesn't have it guess I'm going back online maybe I'll install this app when it gets Yuri
Poor
There is no way There is no way to organize and save which ones youre reading. And you can scrrenshot to come back later. Totally useless.
Mine keeps telling me to reset my time and date which I have been doing. Please help me
It is not any ACTUAL good manga, its all just spoofs or crappy american made ones that otakus made non their computers... SUCKS, DONT DOWNLOAD
Really I can't search for manga and, there's hardly any manga there
Takes too long Every time i launch it
Can i change the type of language Spanish
You can't even look up Manga You have to go through all those to try find one that very well may not even be there
Crap Not worth opening
Trash app
Search More manga Popular manga even Please It has so little manga, and not even known manga.
This sucks Need a search bar or even just more manga...
There's no search bar, what's good if you can't even search for the content you like
Could be better No search and only a few manga
There's no way to look for a specific manga.
