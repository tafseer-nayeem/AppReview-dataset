This would probably be a great game, but it just doesn't translate to a standard Android phone screen well at all. You can't see many of the items you are supposed to collect or the buttons  control details to play the game without having to resort to hints and walkthroughs. Cute robot and clever game scenarios, but not fun to have to read walkthroughs to figure out every scene.
Beautiful game. But it's crashing too much. The load screen says it's on level 12, the game crashes everytime I cross the bridge between the floor with the street musicians and the clock with a fountain.
Glitch Refund please........Completely stuck on fernace level the crane is picking up the critter but not swinging round so I can jump onto the shelf I've researched walkthroughs and the lever sequence is correct my guy is just stuck in the crane next to the shelf....very frustrating I've seen many people say this is a fault with the game.
Crashes It's a great game, unfortunately it keeps crashing on my Xperia, a shame. A real shame considering it cost me over 6 to install.
