Won't even open. I downloaded the game....I try to open it, it automatically closes and says looking for resources to download please fix If it starts working I'll update my review.
Download paused I bought a game which i can't play apparently, i want to go on second stage, but there is content that should be downloaded, and it constantly says download paused even though I'm on wifi.... Fix it please
