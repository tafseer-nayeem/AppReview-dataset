Lots Of Problems The game always gets very laggy when the camera is facing the golden tower and crashes when I'm next to it. Also there are some major texture problems such as the band surrounding the golden tower appearing with the textures of the goat, paintings showing the textures of humans, and sometimes the zombies are completely made up of color changing code. Please help I am on a NookHd tablet
