No longer opens after update UPDATE this happened again and I had to uninstallreinstall to get the app to stop crashing. When will TripIt learn to do an update without crashing Original review This is extremely frustrating since it happened while I am actually ON the vacation that I planned and counted on having TripIt available for. Disappointed to have paid for this  TripIt is a good service, but I need the app to open while I'm on my trip.
App keeps crashing under M. Was working fine before.  I've contacted you in order to give more details. Appreciate a fix ASAP. Thanks
I paid for this I can't even open it All I get is a white screen Update, still doesn't open. Updated again. Now have version 4.2.1 and it still gives me a white screen
Latest version doesn't work App immediately crashes upon opening. Using a Galaxy S6 on Tmobile.
Was Awesome,  now crashes Loved this app till recent update now it simply won't even open... Will  Uninstall and spread the word about how bad it is.
Crashes immediately I love this app, but seriously. How can you roll out an update without realizing it crashes on most devices on start up
