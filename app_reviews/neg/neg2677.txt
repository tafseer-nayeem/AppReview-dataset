Cant shuffle As an editors choice business, i expect the apps to be close to perfection. But the only problem im having is a MAJOR problem. I can't shuffle the letters. When i shake, it just rotates upside down. When i tap 3 times it does absolutely nothing. I paid 2 for this app and i would like for it to work.
