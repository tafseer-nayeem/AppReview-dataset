RARELY works The app is always buffering songs and often refuses to load altogether. It needs some serious work. It also doesn't update no matter how many times you refresh it until weeks after you've been listening to the new songs on your feed on the internet soundcloud. The only reason it gets two stars instead of 1 is because when it does work on rare occasions, you can close the app and still listen to music unlike youtube.
The last update messed up things for me and somehow the app stopped playing music continously in my Playlists. It's annoying that I can't listen to the next song unless I hit the 'next' button, and imagine doing that all the time. Fix it, for now I'm gonna give it  2 stars.
It was good but recent update... The new update really screwed everything up in terms of accessibility. While the U.I seems to look better, the things that you can do in it was cut down dramatically. Went from 5 stars to 2.
Still not fixed. I'm still following the person that I unfollowed it's happening since last update. This new update is not good enough it takes to much time to play tracks. I want to Uninstall this update. Please do something.
bugy version The tracks doesn't  work unless  I restart  my tablet, actually it's  playing  with count zero and no sound. BTW I love the new design  for tablet.
WTF WITH THIS UPDATE I don't like the new update.  I liked the old way.   like I Love using soundcloud for music    but the old way was easy,  but with this new update it's not the same  and it's confusing       u should have an option were we could downgrade  to the older version    That would be great if you could do that        it would also be great if you had an option to remove a playlist
Fix it and get 5 stars The songs you want play takes a very long time until start playing, fix this please.
