They fool the consumers When you know what devise I am using why are you allowing me to download the app at the first instance. Just say the app is not supported on your devise when I try to install it. They are fooling the consumers by allowing them to download the app and then on installation they say your phone does not have a magnet. Huh.. Why will my phone have a magnet.. Nobody should download this app.
