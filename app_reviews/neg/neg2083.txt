Absolutely Sucks Not like the original Hitman game.  Comparable to a chess or checkers app. If you're into that,  get one of the thousands of free ones and save the 4.99. But, if you're looking for a Hitman game don't get this. It's a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.
Looks nice but gets dull It's fun for a few levels but after you realize it really is  nothing more than a variation on Go or Checkers, and your choices are just limited to moving in one direction, one space at a time.
Hate it This game is far too frustrating, and not nearly rewarding enough. I feel no sense of accomplishment when I finish the levels. I understand the appeal of this game, but most of the levels you can't even take the enemies out, you just have to sneak by. It's just not satisfying. I can't believe this game has so many good reviews, definitely not worth 5
