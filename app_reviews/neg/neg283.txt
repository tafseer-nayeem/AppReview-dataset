A chore to finish It's rare I don't give hidden object game at least 3 stars...and I am normally quite okay with ignoring the irrelevance of storylines and other failings...but this game really had me disengaged. I'm struggling to give specific reasons why....hidden object areas few and far between, the potion gimmick didn't enhance just got annoying, the phrases used in character interaction were laughable. I buy a lot of this genre, and I do not recommend this one at all.
Several crashes and a corrupted file message that made me have to restart from the beginning
