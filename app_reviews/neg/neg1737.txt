Disappointment I tried for a whole week to book a reservation and not one single person accepted my request. I tried 6 different cars all located within BWI. I guess they should implement a better schedule this way we do not have to wait for a day or more to find out if the car is available or not. For now conventional rental companies are more expensive but reliable.
Bad business I haven't even rented yet and been denied access  WHY THEN U GUYS TAKE MY INFORMATION FOR NO REASON
It's ok. Turo, is still a decent and kinda convenient app, BUT it is definitely not as good as relay rides was. I lose connection regularly, and most unfortunately, they took away the map option when you're on a car profile. I use to be able to select a car and then select a map to see what neighborhood the cat was in if I didn't recognize it, now I can't. I have to hunt all over the big map and click the dang dots until I find it.
Waiting on a refund was supposed to receive a refund because the owner I had a reservation with didn't meet me when picking up the car. Been a week now and nothing on turos end.
Easy crash Choosing the same start and end date for a rental crashes the app for me
All down hill Terrible approval process.. Too small of a community to find decent cars to rent.  Sad when the big rental car agencies have better service and selection than a p2p app
My name is Honestly I'll stick with Enterprise, at least I know their name, what is a Turo or Turbo or whatever they are calling themselves now
Sucks Most cars cannot be rented waist of time and planning cars are showing available when they aren't a lot of stipulations and be.
Doesn't work I tried to approve my account one million times but the app ever broke
Don't like it it needs to have phone
