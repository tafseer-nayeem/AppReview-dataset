Not that much as expected bicep n tricep are mixed nothing for fore arm
There is a right balance between a free app and the number of ads...this app has it all wrong. So many ads that it is borderline unusable, unfortunate because it seems like some thought was put into making it...or just let me remove the adds for a 1 or 2.
Full page ad w every click Really I never review apps. Don't have the time. This app might be worthy of five stars but every time I click a workout, a full page ad pops up. I understand paying bills... but this is greed to the point I don't think they care if their app is even seen.
Too many bloody full screen ads. Get rid of the full screen ones Ruins the experience in an otherwise good app
It could've been good with less ads
Ads everywhere Besides, I cannot organize multiple workouts nor add weights
crashes it's just crashes on my redmi2 prime
Not good ..... No comments
To many adds Would be a good app to use, but everything you click on you get a add.
Eh If you wanna do basic stuff with an ad every time you look at the app then yea its great. For people who want to include things like shrugs or upright rows with a cable machine  not the app you want. Most likely will delete it next week after getting sick of all the ads and no good features
