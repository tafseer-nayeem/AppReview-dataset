Valdosta Ga Tells me to check my Internet connection when I try to search it but I have full service not liking   anywhere else works been doing this for two days now
J.H. Liked it at first kept me from going all over town looking  Now its telling me to check my connection  Now I'm unsubscribeing
Rentals Funny but when you call either they don't exist or have been rented especially if the rent was low cost. I think their rental app is just as unreliable as their Real Estate sales app. No updating on sales of homes or rentals for that matter. Waste of time and energy
I'm having a hard enough time ad it is. I shouldn't have even done the update. Now it won't allow me to log in using Google. WTF Seriously, can I get ah fckin break or what
Needs fixing, lots of problems It keeps saying no internet connection cant see any properties.
