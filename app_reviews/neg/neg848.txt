No decimal Super unimpressed. I purchased this app because of all the reviews and complaints were actually addressed by the developer so I thought, great They must actually care Why can I not use decimal points Sorta defeats the purpose when you can't keep track of your money as closely as possible. I want my money back.
Reconcilliation I have installed this app,  and I have made my first month's entries and set up all of my accounts.  I want to rate this 5 stars, except I cannot find the reconcilliation button and ask for help, I hear nothing. Please restore my faith.
Disappointing Have been using kmymoney on a Linux laptop.  Hoped this would be a good alternative to use on a tablet or smartphone.  Used it for a month and found nothing was easier and many things harder, especially recurring transactions.  Could not even find a feature to reconcile balance with bank statement.
