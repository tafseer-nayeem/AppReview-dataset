Uuuuugggg This is so sensitive. I hit one of the drums I have to wait a second for the sound to go of. So a good beat ends up sounding terrible.
Don't waste your time Bad app. Time drags. Corny drum loops. Useless. Try Drum Genius it's much better for drum loops and practice app.
Delay is terrible I'm using on galaxy note 5 and it is almost unplayable because of the audio lag with the drum pads. Fix the issue and it'll be perfect.
Delay typing In asus zenfone 2 ZE551ML with Ram 4GB, have a delay every typetouch. Please fix the issue
Kindly to check it back It delayed when hitting the instruments, on my zenfone 6
Very laggy Timing is all in drums. Please just respect that and make this app in time as users tap
So much lag This app is so laggy it's unusable when trying to couple with music.  Even without other music the lag is unreal.  I'm a drummer and was trying to show a beat idea to a friend because tapping on the table wouldn't suffice.  It ended up being better than using this app.
it trojanned an app called 9apps, not cool bro, not cool. reported
LAME Really No demo or something I'm gonna take drum lessons and I can't copy a single beat on a game Add some audio or something to copy bc this is wayyyyyyyy lame
laggy I love this apps but dont know why its so laggy since updated to new version. im using zenfone 5.
Hang my machine It freeze my new phone using Android 5.0.2 on more than a few occasions. During the freeze, the phone will either boots itself or I need to remove the battery to hard booth the phone. Other than that, the drumming is not bad especially if hook up to a set of moderate desk top speakers.
Didn't work on zenfone 2
