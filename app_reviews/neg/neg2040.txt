Gray screen Was excited to play this game, but there is a gray screen on start up. I loved this game on my old ohone. Hoping for a fix.
Issues on galaxy s6 The first time I opened the app it sat at a grey screen and gave me the dialog for the tutorial and when I restarted my phone it got stuck on the loading screen while still saying I was playing the game. I have the new galaxy s6 phone. The game looks beautiful I just wish I could play it.
Doesn't work on Galaxy S6 Seems like a great idea and looks interesting  but it doesn't work on a galaxy s6. At the moment it's just a grey screen and some text but you can't see anything. I'd appreciate if you could fix this because as of now I've just wasted my money which sucks.                                                                            TLDR This game does not work on a galaxy s6, don't buy it if you have one. Devs, pls fix.
Kind of works. I can play it on my tablet, but when I want to play it on my phone where I would actually play it it just shows an off white screen and I hear the normal game play audio. Can't recommend it for this reason.
Grey Screen Galaxy S6  S6 Edge Amazing game for mobile standards, switched to next gen devices and now the game only dosplays a grey screen with music running on an endless loop. Really dissapointed, can only hope for a fix.
I wish I could get it to work I've played this on my friends phone and I decided to buy it but it doesn't work on my s6 edge, the screen becomes grey and I can't see anything other than the dialogue. I got a refund once but I bought it again to try to reinstall it. I'm not sure how to fix it or get a refund
Gray screen gs6 I can hear the game but just have a gray screen.  I tried reinstalling but same thing.
