Can't longin Am using this app for last 3 years.. Usually i lock this app with password...it was working fine till last week...now suddenly i unable to login with my password.. I tired many time's and frustrated with this bug.. Pls help me to solve this..
Worked at one time Loved the app until it quit allowing me to select subcategories. I did a back up and then reinstalled the app. The back up option does NOT work. I lost 8 months of data.
No aftersales service At beginning, it was good, but recently it cannot backup with excel format.  More worst is that, no customer service respond about this problem
no new features, no update. for long time . disappointing
