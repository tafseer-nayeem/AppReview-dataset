Can't connect to 96 Chevy Tahoe The Bluetooth won't connect to the elm 327 mini.....worked on the 2008 gmc Sierra however.
This used to be a 5  app. awhile ago. But a few Updates back I noticed that even if you force close Torque, after you Reboot your device, The Torque app. Starts Running in the BACKGROUND 247 even if you haven't opened the application at all. You really need to FIX this application so that it isn't ever running in the background unless you opened it on purpose. There is no point for this application to be running in the background 247.  It's an Epic Issue and a complete waste of people's Battery.
Its looks like a really nice and powerful app but if only it can work with PLX KIWI2BT device I would rate it 5 Star as I have no way to test this app and I have even bought the pro version
