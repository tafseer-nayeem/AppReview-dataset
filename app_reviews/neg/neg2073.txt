Cant install. Error shows. Already paid. Yeah. What I said. Help me fix it for more stars. Device storage has 3gb left. No sd card, I took it out. Android 4.4. Samsung E7.
Never saves where I leave off , I have the google play saved games . I'll finish 3 levels at a time shut it off come back at a later time I'm back where I started I even take screen shots to prove where I was. On a lighter note game is fun. How do I get a refund.
The truth Absoultely beautiful but im here to tell you why it wasnt worth it, i got at least 112 hours out of the game before it ended, i was so disapointed. Such a beautiful game but is 6 dollars really worth 5 levels that arent that hard And to get 5 more levels you need to spend 3 more dollars It isnt worth it.
True review Great looking but takes a max of 20 min to beat. No replay value at all. I would suggest Limbo if your interested in this game.
