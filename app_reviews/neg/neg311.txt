Music keeps stopping This has been my favorite music service for years and I'm a big supporter but for some reason, about every 10 minutes the music stops in the middle of playing. It says im offline for a couple of seconds before realizing that im not actually offline. Please fix spotify.
Suggested Songs Are Way Off What happened to the thumbsdown feature Most suggested songs I get are way off and I end up quitting the app once I run out of skips bc it suggests the WORST songs. Listening to musicals gets you Miley Cyrus and Zedd Wtf And it doesn't play enough of a playlist before suggesting other songs, which is just ridiculous
Still not perfect for Android wear I can choose radio and play the music from my Android Wear. As soon as I press I choose, it starts playing on my phone.. And Spotify just disappears from Android wear.. No ability to pause, play next etc...
Hello No Equalizer on Android Super SLOW. Stop doing trivial updates and enhance performance We are paying 9.99, we demand service When is the Android version getting Equalizer, like IPhone I have seen Equalizer in older Spotify versions like 2.3 Also use too many resources. Please fix it. And please include an exit app button.
May drop this Got the new note, and have major issues with this service now. Can't connect clearly to other devices and even plays music well after I disconnect. Laughable that this is the quality of service to be provided. Was five stars soon to be one and a cancellation of premium.
Could be great The idea of it is wonderful,  but it freezes on every other song.A for concept,  F for execution.
App keeps crashing After about 3 songs the app will randomly crash, this has been happening every since the second most recent update
