I don't know why but now it works terrible After the recent update of kindle Voyage, this app could not push anything to my kindle..... Then, after one or two hours of jam, it works again, but this time it gives me a lot of anti communist articles I don't even know where it comes from. This is weird, so weird.
doesn't work on 'kindle.cn' address
Problem with letters Arabic letters appears separated..should be connected to each other... The other free app send it quite well.
Works sometimes
