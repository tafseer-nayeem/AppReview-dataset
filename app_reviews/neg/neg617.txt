Poor, you will regret buying it Poor attempt, rubbish and sound doesn't work. It's like developer has half made the game then give up...can't justify paying for THIS drivel. Deleted...enough said.
The description of the app says you can challenge your friends via local wifi. This is not an option in the game. I feel that the description is extremely misleading possibly even a straight up lie. Either add wifi or remove statement from description.
BUGS CRASHES FIX IT Waste of money wish I never purchased  Always crashing. Dont waste your money on this. I want my money back. Warning
Sounds great but... App is garbage. Crashes as soon as game starts. Would love to play but FIX THIS. I want my money back
Very bland. Its all so very basic. Alex Trebek is nowhere to be found in this app, and that alone would have made this so much better As it is, this game is just a dolled up basic quiz game that a programming undergrad could knock out in a weekend. The actual game has very little in the way of sound, just some voices would have been amazing Unfortunately, I will be asking for a refund.
Multiple choice Really What is the point It is nothing like the show. Also, why can't you see your opponents' totals when wagering for Final
