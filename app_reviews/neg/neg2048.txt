Did not purchase This app just showed up in my account as I downloaded today but I would never buy an app like this plz check yr account and remove my email I'm unsure how it got there
Not a bad app, however Love the fact I can play all my old fave games on my phone, however all of my ss keep disappearing and when I try to save to mem card it also keeps disappearing. Massive pain fix this for 5 stars
Broken Ran fine, then wouldn't acknowledge any of my saves but said i have all games saved, now after reinstalling it it runs in some HLE mode and won't save and just boots me out. It was great and fun when i first got it, now it's useless.
Don't buy The emulator doesn't even work. I tried to download games and it doesn't play any of them. The free ones work better than this.
game issue i love the app..because it allows me to play my favorite game monster rancher 2..but everytime i use discstone it only gives me 1 same monster for all the game that i use..and i hate that monster..and for combining monsters..the stats are not accurate or not being addedcalculated properly..
NO FXXXING MUSIC Downloaded the latest version and now half my games are without music and or missing sound effects. They were working flawlessly until I updated.
