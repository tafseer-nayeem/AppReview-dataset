Cute, but sluggish Graphics WAY too slow sluggish response to finger taps on my tablet make game play frustrating.  Got to level 20 and uninstalled....
It keeps stealing all my lives won't let me play and it keeps kicking me off sending me back to my regular phone screen. This game sucks
Whenever I try to play my cell gets switched off n d battery gets drained completely
It was horrible when you get to the end it does the work for you. I want to play the game for myself
