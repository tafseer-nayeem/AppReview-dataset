No vault... I love all the apps from cheetah mobile and have always rated 5 stars. But there is something wrong with this app. The vault feature highlighted in the description doesn't seem to appear in lollipop from a long time on most of the devices, i've tried on galaxy s4, xperia z1 and now on asus ZenFone 2. I've even dropped a mail to the team regarding this issue, but they didn't replied, the team is being careless...
Bloody updates Bloody updates EVERY SINGLE DAY And the description of why the update is needed is always the same Starting to become suspicious whether this app works as a anti virus app at all....  And another update within the same day One star is too much for this garbage. New comers, be aware of updating this app multiple times every day just to feel a little safer.
