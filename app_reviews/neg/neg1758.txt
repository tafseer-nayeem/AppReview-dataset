Poor at handling weekend closures Quick  good UI  BUT lots of glitches Does not show London fare zones. Portrait mode only. London version handles weekend tube closures badly  doesn't take note of closures when using future dated search only seems to work OK at the weekend. Can't search by bus stop number. Bike and walking summary should show distance not calories. Circle line shown using same colour as main roads
Going downhill in a hurry This used to be a GREAT app, it used to provide all the quickest and cheapest routes across town. Nowadays the routes are not the quickest routes and are usually the most expensive What happened to you Citymapper
