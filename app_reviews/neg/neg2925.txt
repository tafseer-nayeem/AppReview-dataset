Great game but... As of this latest update, get an error saying I cannot update. So I thought I'd try a reinstall. Turns out I can't do that either. So as of now, no more San Juan on my tablet. Gee thanks. Refund time
Game no longer works I have a Lenovo 7600 tablet and the cards and some of the text fields are invisible on it making the game unplayable. Please fix.
Online gaming limited. Local wins not counting towards achievements. It used to track progress but after the last update, it no longer does. I reduced my rating from 4 to 1. Fix this and I will give those stars back.
