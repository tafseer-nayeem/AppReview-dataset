Disappointed I'm somewhat disappointed with this app especially since I spent money for it. Initially I thought it worked great but lately when my son uses it there is no Elmo just a blank screen  that has happened more times than not. If I hadn't payed for I would have deleted it by now.
Whatever Why is there a thumb scanner It does nothing. It will not open when attempting to bypass the thumb scanner. The app simply crashes. I was going to show it to my 3 year old grandson tomorrow at his birthday party. According to your description of the app. I believe he would have liked it. I will keep it for a week or so. To give you time to fix it please do so.
. accidentally deleted the album from my gallery for the video calls  now the video calls don't work on app
