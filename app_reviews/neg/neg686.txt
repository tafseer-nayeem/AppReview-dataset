Print graphic quality poor. Printing from tablet difficult Daughter created outfit with my android tablet.  The only way we could print was to print to a pdf through some conversion process no direct print to printer. We test printed to paper first and graphics were terribly pixilated. When we finally printed on the fabric, it didn't line up properly.  I am highly disappointed. Will have to try the computer version....hoping that way actually works
