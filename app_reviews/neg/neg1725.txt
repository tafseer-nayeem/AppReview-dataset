Once I paid for this app, certain features within the app no longer worked.
Won't connect For some reason my Droid Maxx does not read the WiFi signal from the OBD scan tool. So I can't us it. I hope there is a cure for this problem. I would like to us it on my new phone.
App not licensed even though I paid for it Can't use it after payment
Crap did not connect to device
Wont connect It wont conect to my obd2 bluetooth that plugs into ecu,  the torque app works fine
Wont connect I have tried connecting it to My 2001 Mercury Grand Marquis, with the protocols sent to Automatic and with specifying the manufacturers call out for the OBD2 Protocal. I also confirmed that the vehicle is OBD2 certified. The app says it connects to the interface, but can not connect to the vehicle. Please advise or refund.
