Downloaded, just started game. BOOM Ad Comercial in the middle of play. Sucks....
Interesting concept. Won't go full screen.  Ads block 50 of the rest.   Slow play.  Can't move multiple at once.  No timer.  Menu option for bank was empty.   Keep trying guys.  But I'm uninstalling
Stupid That's good to be the worst game out there.  Won't go to full screen and before I could even play the 1st time a dam advertisement took over. Uninstalled within 2mins of downloading it.
Game is super tiny on my droid turbo.
