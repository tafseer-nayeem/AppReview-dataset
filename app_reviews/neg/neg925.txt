12 out of 36087 Don't waste your time.  Completely useless. It is possible it has good information, but it was not viewable because the quantity of ads prevented function. I'm not exaggerating. No matter how many ads I shut, another blocked the application screen or opened the play store within one or fewer seconds. Deleted within ten minutes of startup. Not to mention it's incredibly unhealthy to lose more than four or five pounds in a week.

Like really... Ok first off IF you want to lose weight ditch the potatoes And Banana is actually good for you just 12 of one daily in a smoothie. OK so veggies to EAT daily to help you feel FULL broccoli, carrot, celery, cauliflower, zucchini, squash etc you can EAT as much as you want during the day. Secondly NO WHEAT NO DAIRY except plain Greek yogurt  products. You need 12 oz of protein daily Chicken, Fish, Or Turkey And rice protein powder  NO WHITE SUGAR and only 34 of brown rice.
It didn't open Didn't work on my Samsung phone
Unimpressed The grammar used in this app is atrocious and an ad pops up every few minutes.  This app is quite underdeveloped as all it really does is state things found on the internet.
