Its good I love it I edited some of my pix my friends was like mmm Austin where did u get such an app for this wonderful art work and I was like woah. I love the app
It's doing to much. This app just decided to make itself my wallpaper with out warning me. And it didn't work for me at all. Plus to many ads.
Holding frames It's awesome, but u must put more frames big ups
