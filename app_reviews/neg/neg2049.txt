Help Needed  Since the new update, all of my previously owned items that I've earned are now gone... And worlds are locked... Coin doubler missing... Missing gems... Locked costumes... All the time spent on gathering items to get everything unlocked. I know you have records that show any purchases, so I would think it would be your responsibility to fix these issues...
Stopped Working on Tablet APP STOPPED WORKING. UNINSTALLED REINSTALLED. LOST ALL GAME DATA AND IN APP PURCHASES. THEY DID NOT FIX THE CLOUD SAVING BUG. FIX LISTED HERE DOES NOT WORK. DEV TEAM HAS NOT YET RESPONDED TO EMAILS DO NOT BUY.
Omg Well even after the update I still do not have all my stuff. This really blows. I still play the game though and I'll probably own everything before you guys fix it. I did go through the recommended steps but it didn't work neither on my Nexus 7 2nd Gen nor my Galaxy Note 3 or my dinosaur Acer A500. Please fix it man
Does not work I cant open the app it gets up to a part that says tap to jump on the menu and then crasnes google is not accepting my reports
Love the game but there's a bug on my Xperia z4 tablet  after a run, the game crashes and im unable to press skip to go again
Fun game but a few BAD glitches Occasionally , after purchasing levels with in game money, they relocked themselves as well as some other smaller purchased items. Dont worry about it too much because after a while they do come back. Also, the screen sticks after the 'proccessing request'for a coin package happens. Still a really fun game tho.
THIS GAME IS UNACCEPTABLE IT DOESN'T GLOBBING WORK. Every time I turn it on, it goes to the start and then says sorry Ski safari HAS STOPPED WORK. I REALLY WANT TO TRY IT. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE FIX IT
Wonderful and colorful Ski adventure. Beautiful map and many funny characters to ski together. Update After the latest update, i lost almost everything Maps, costumes and collected stuff. Update After updated, still lost my gems, having 9k of golds, all maps gone, all upgrade gone. Great jobs
Cool Game really bad dev It is super fun and addictive but all my progress is lost, had almost everything unlocked now I can only see my achievements but I have to buy everything again Even tried clearing the data and login in from different parts of the game and did not work.
What the stuff The new update WAS awesome until it reset and took all my stuff Worse yet it happened in the middle of a run Just went to the home screen, wiped out all my money, upgrades and slopes This sucks
