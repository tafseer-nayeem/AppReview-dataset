Crasher Just finished updating this app few mins ago because I was forced to. Now it wont even open the app. Please fix You have been bragging about your  1  Best Mobile App.
I never say I hate anything But I will say I haven't  been  able  to  access  my account  for  3 weeks. Thought  this  would  be  fix soon. White screen  then message  window saying  Geico isn't  responding.  I need this app because  I  have  to  update  my automatic payment  by 16th of Nov. 2015.  Please help me soon.
Wont open after being forced to update I was pulled over and couldnt provide my proof of insurance Thanks for the ticket
Hard to have such an award winning app when everything I try to do gives me the Something Went Wrong error.... Then when it works, says I have to save my ID card to device every time I access it, what's the point of saving if it won't ever truly save it
SLOW, but useful The one good thing about this app is that has all the features you would want out of an app for GEICO. The bad thing is that it is horribly slow Using a Nexus 5, and the app can take A LONG time, sometimes 30 seconds, just open, and then has you wait forever every time you open anything within the app. I will spend about 10 seconds actually making the change, and 2 minutes just looking at please wait for every link.
Will not load Haven't been able to launch the app since the previous update before this one. Thought the new update will work. I was too hopeful. Just going to uninstall and web version.
RN I have a clean driving record and I'm being charged for full coverage 155.00 a month for a 2007 KIA Optima LX and I'm 52. I Know friends who are younger then me are paying less.
Issues If you have more than one vehicle which I do. This app only let's you put in one vehicle. So I guess Geico prefers not to allow a person to insure all their vehicles with them. How weird is that
