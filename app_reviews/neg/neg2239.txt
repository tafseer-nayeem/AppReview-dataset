BIG RIP OFF GAME  Garbage app don't waste time or money if you win big game freezes and you don't get winnings Ripped me off 3 times tonight. Contact us In app does not work. just keeps asking for a valid email even when i enter correct email obviously they want no real feedback. Wish I could rate lower.
Will return a score of 5 stars when the rest of the bonanza trail is added to Android phones.
Poor Payouts I wish I had read the reviews before hand.  I won the most money without purchasing any coins.  Once I paid the  first time it went down hill from there.  All they do is take take take.  Heaven forbid you win big, the game will kick you out and you won't see a dime of the payout.  Such a rip off
Not the game it use to be
Been playing this game for a couple of years now but your payouts and bonuses are getting fewer and far between..disappointing as i very much enjoyed playing this game.it fills in the time since my husband died..can't get ahead anymore to keep playing..WHY SO STINGY

Slots Bonanza It  changes  my bet, when  it gets ready  and I lost my money.  Don't  do that.  What's  wrong  with  that Now it stops whenever it gets  ready.
Slots Bonanza Very few payouts, just want you to keep buying....friends uninstalling this game...
