Voice does NOT continue Voice only heard in the beginning No use while driving without voice telling step by step. NEED TO  FIX. Can cause accident because you have to  look at phone while driving
useless app won't come up on my phone at all won't give me accurate readings
Dissapointed App used to work great then started telling me there were no routes available to every location I try to gps.
Waste just a wiget It's basically jus a widget and connects you to Google maps I'd it's in ur phone so really jus a waste of my time .
 I am downloading this for an upcoming trip... I can't really rate the app before ever trying it, but the system insists I rate it Maybe I would give it a higher rating, if I was actually able to use it first
No good I might as well stick to normal google maps. This is a waist
Was working great until yesterday it just stopped working push in location it said waiting for location nothing happened good thing I was familiar with the area or I would have been screwed I tried it again it said map not responding this sucks
Don't bother Uses Google maps. Great if you have internet connection. Use Navfree.
Just downloaded Will give more stars as I begin to use the app hopefully I won't have to uninstall well I'll be seeing you all soon for another rate
