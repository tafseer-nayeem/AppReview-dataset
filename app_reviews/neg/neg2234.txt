Jackpot party is bs It says you have to get one less jackpot thing to win the same as getting 5 in a row on the games that have the jackpot party next to them i hit 4 in a row and all it did was pay me what you get for getting 4 in a row i hit it another time but with a wild on the end making 5 in a row it didnt pay but what u get for that and the first 4 in a row had no wilds.... I should have won 600million just on one of those this game is B.S.
You are lucky to get one star. Why does this happen when we the players go to retrive friends it freezes up Still needs work. So still one star. Let me put it nice and simple. From here on in. Don't expect me to give anymore gifts to friends. If I only get lets say 250 then that's all that I give. My daughter can run this better than you guy's. Still only one star.

Hard to win Impossible to win jackpots.. I'm almost to level 8..so I play alot. I won 1 jackpot and that was when they lower standards on jackpot party Fridays months ago. Jackpots are impossible.
A LOT OF ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE FIXED I LOVE PLAYING THIS GAME BUT THIS APP HAS A LOT OF ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE FIXED.. YOU GET BOOTED CONSTANTLY WHEN YOU HIT SCATTERS OR BONUS SPINS.. INCORRECT PAYOUTS.. CAN'T ALWAYS SHARE WHEEL SPIN.. ETC, ETC.. Y'ALL NEED TO FIX THE ISSUES AND STOP BLAMING IT ON THE PLAYERS
At first it was great. I was really enjoying this app. Not anymore  I thought for sure that if I actually spent real money to try to get my balance back up that I would make a few good wins. No it just ate those coins right up too. DON'T BUY THE COINS You will just loose them. All in the same day. Jackpot party is a joke now. Doesn't make you want to buy more coins, just frustrates you that it just eats them all up. LOOK At  THE OTHER REVIEWS. THIS APP SUX  NOW.
Crashes too often In the past several weeks I have hit some some big jackpots and the app automatically shuts down prior to payout so I never receive the payout. I've written the help desk and and sent reports, all i got in return is some textbook answer blaming my device or connection. Can't even calculate the millions in credits I've lost. Thankfully I never have and never will actually pay for credits. Just play free credits for fun.
Would give 0 stars ,Have played for 2 years and have never got a jackpot....never , probably because I refuse to feed real money to a slot GAME.... what a bunch of stingy aholes
2yrs playing Great game with a variety of slots each with there own bonuses that's all that is good about it. Have spent well over 600 in the 2yrs playing with much shock haven't hit a jackpot yet I still refuse to pay anymore  it was one of my top games until resent update. It now sux
Still sucks Crap as of 111515 crap crap crap This game sucks 109 million credits not one big  You guys suck. I find it funny after every insult i make twards this crappy game they erase it and change my date bring it on you suck and im not stopping until your game changes Crap crap crap 20 million ate it, 40 million ate it, 50 million ate it a waste of time this sucks You deserve a 0 instead of a 1 rating 120 million no wins again
What a joke Hey you all what you all think of this joke of a room now. They lost all their big paying customers cause we all got tired watching it go down hill with their greed. Don't spend money in here you will lose it all. I know I lose 1000's in here. And when they text your Facebook and tell ya it's your turn to win a big jackpot it's all a lie it's just to lure you back in to rob you of more money. IT'S ALL A SCAM  FAULD  they won't get another penny of my.
POS App Since last update can not log on to play unless I turn my wifi off and play on my mobile data, I refuse to eat my data to lose faster than can collect. And when you do win you log out and back in only to have chips stolen when not even playing.  Customer service is a joke, animated response for everything. And why do they not respond on reviews like other games Crap game now....
