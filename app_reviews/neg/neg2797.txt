It won't load I am a huge fan of the board game and was excited about the digital version. But it won't load so 7 bucks wasted, thanks.
Doesn't work on Samsung s6 Not sure why it doesn't work on s6 edge. Sucks
Good game but not a lot of replay value in current form. Please consider either bulking up the AI or adding online play to justify the cost. Cannot fathom how this game could cost more than Ticket to Ride or SmallWorld 2 Would love to give 5 stars.
Download failed because you may not have purchased this app  What the heck  I certainly DID purchase the app.  Played it for a while too.  Then didn't play for a month and when I tried to run it, got this...  Liked it ok when it worked, but can't give more than one star of they're going to have bugs that prevent legal buyers from playing it.
Downloaded and paid but will not open at all.
Cant run it. Used to work fine on my LG G2. Now it crashes after a few seconds on the loading screen. Please help
