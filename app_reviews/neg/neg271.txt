Mapquest is terrible I've used and liked this app for several years, but the recent change to a mapquest background layer will have me looking for a replacement.  Quite inaccurate and actually ridiculous.  Some of the local landmarks are even named vulgar offensive terms. I want Google maps back
Always with the new updates that ruin it Why oh why does some software engineer want to update something that isn't broken,  most likely just to earn his pay. Was 5 stars now is only 2 stars.  Please take lessons from other failed apps that let the programmer update what isn't needed and ruin a good app.
