Useless There is no option to repeat once completed. How do the designer thought that a child can learn any alphabet only in one time It's useless for learning purpose. Just a time pass
I'm a teacher and love the idea, but I realized  that the train will not follow if you go fast around the letter. It also will jump back to the start of the line on the letter even if I go slow. This would be frustrating for first graders.
If you are going to make a kids app please make sure it works. The D charachter does not work. Try again....absolute rubbish
Shenika Martin My two year old son loves this game
Can't Open App Since Update I got this game for my son, did the update, now unable to open app... Uninstalling, unfortunately.
Trace the Letters This is too difficult for small children to do as if you are off even a millimetre train goes back to start, and as thr screen becomes a little greasy from little fingers it is impossible to finish the letter. Glad I didn't pay for it
Well its ok All u do is drag a train on lines of press Dots
It's not free You have to pay to get pass the info
There's no quit button ...how to quit out of the app
I give 5 stars if u remove animated pictures
No back button. Can't exit game. Its just drawing lines. Ughhh
My son is happy for you games. Dhaka
Just very frustrating. So sensitive even I can't do it reliably.
