 This game is the worst I can't even play what kind of game is thiswhy can't I play this just once LET ME PLAY THIS GAME
Keeps resetting progress I really liked the game but it keeps resetting my progress. I've lost  70 on in app purchases.
There are a few lags on this game and it would be great if we could get the lags fixed. Nick. Please if you have read just please help us out with the lags
I love the game but.... It keeps lagging and freezing and taking my jelly but not the product. Also my different buildings like the Kristy Krabb keep losing time and the production of food just stops. I have contacted you guys and you said it was my time but it definitely is not. I have a galaxy s5. I wish I had seen that it sucks for android.
Won't download Everytime I get to the installing part it says error please try again. If error continues contact support. WTH I bought the app and can't even play it
