Lost every search I've completed I was playing game, paused for a couple minutes, everything was gone. I had completed many of the sections 100. Seriously frustrated Wth did y'all do
It is sort of working. I can now open the puzzles but it doesn't seem to keep track of the score right.   And sorry I deleted email address.
Will not open Program worked last week and now it won't go past picking a topic.  I have a Samsung tablet.  I assume last update messed it up. I Uninstalled and reinstalled it twice.  Please find fix.
 horrible This game is the worst This is coming from a person who loves word searches. I clicked on the hint button and it revealed a BONUS word What kind of hint is that I would NOT recommend this game to ANYONE  I would really change what type of hints you make.
