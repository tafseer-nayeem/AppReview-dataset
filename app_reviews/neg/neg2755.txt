ALL VIRTUAL BUTTONS ARE STILL VISIBLE I think that I mentioned this one before on this app or another of the fisher price apps, the virtual buttons at the bottom of the screen are still visible to my son. He keeps pressing the back and home buttons all the time. In this update I was hoping that this would have been resolved, but still hasn't been. Please fix For reference I have a Sony Xperia Z1.
Have you heard of MULTI TOUCH Whoever built this app clearly does not have a small child. MULTI TOUCH DOES NOT WORK If the child is touching the screen with 1 hand he cannot do ANYTHING with the other hand. This is SO STUPID that it makes the app almost unusable.
No internet No internet, no play  uninstall. You try and explain to a 2 year old he cannot play his game when you on the road without mobile reception.
It doesn't work Please fix app. It's not opening...
Only a black screen We love all the other Fisher Price apps and were looking forward to this one, but when we start it, you can hear the voices, but it's only a black screen. Have tried reinstalling several times, but no go. Wanted to like it, but it's not working for us.
Basic Shapes Change the star and heart to a square and rectangle. We need the basic shapes.
Loved this app until it stopped working completely  It's my son's favorite and now he has a meltdown every time he tries to use it because we never get it to load past the FP screen with all the characters. Please fix and I'll fix my review
I cannot get past the main screen. It just clicks when I try to do anything 
Stop working Suddenly all apps of yours is not responding and working on my note 2.
Frustrating My son loves it.  But now that we have had it a week. It freezes when we try to open it.
Eh My son liked it for a week
