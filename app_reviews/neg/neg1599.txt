After the update Overall, it was a great app and I really loved it but after the update, it just won't open even though I tried for the nth time. All there is, is a black screen.I hope you can fix it. Thank you.
Liked it but What the hell after the new update it's not even opening I emailed them about the problem for 3 days and no reply this how u treat your paying customer
Why do I have to repurchase I purchased and have been using manga rock for a long time now so why is it asking me to purchase the app and giving me ads again now after the previous update.
It doesnt work... I dunno why but whenever i choose a manga it loads but it doesnt show anything. It just shows a square with a crack on the middle how do i solve this
Used to be good I've been using this app for 2 years and now all of a sudden we have to pay for download slots  Wat
Won't open after update It was working perfectly well. After updating, it won't open anymore and it crashes.
Cant download Please fix it..i am giving a bad rate because i cant download...i can read it just fine
First time i used it.. I downloaded 10 chapters from one of the story, then i closed the apps, then when i open again this apps, it doesnt respond anymore, so many times attempting to open it but doesnt respond.. the reason i uninstalled it ..
Would get 5 stars but since the update it's making me re purchase  the full version n which isn't on
