Good but useless app for domestic cricket followers Can't see current Ranji trophy matches anywhere. What's the point of the app in Indian local language if it is not showing scorecards of India domestic cricket matches.
More to do Lack the basic features like share the score read out and also the Hindi commentary is not enough
Please don't update... Please don't update this cricket app.you before update using this app is very good but after update it is very slow and suddenly automatic shut down.
I hate India...... I always hate India...India me achay log b hin...lekan ganday aur kamina log bahot zyada hin.jaisay shew sina.
Where is malayalam Malayalam is the one of the important language in india. It is a classical language also. So add malayalam also
