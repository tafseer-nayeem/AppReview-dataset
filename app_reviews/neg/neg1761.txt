My Pictures and videos Why in the ever lovin F would a GPS app need permission to use my pictures and videos
Total mistake It even doesn't catch a satellite, when here maps or google maps do it in a minute or two, this app doesn't worth a minute of your personal time.
Can't get it to work Won't start
Worng app
Zero
Terribly innacurate From Sydney AU. Thoroughly tested this always inaccurate, even with multiple satellite connections. Not sure if this is the nature of these kind of apps, though comparing this to my vehicles speed it was terribly unreliable
Totally incorrect speed Showing half the actual speed of the vehicle.....waste app
No speed 7 hours of tries. connected to satellites once and lost it again in 24 seconds. Only successful attempt. Rubbish app, will not show speed. One star as the compass sort of works. GPS do not, do you have to be at an absolute standstill for it to connect
Doesnt work Went from 0 62 on the highway and we were still driving and it went back down to 0, so.  Innacurate
Doesn't initialize reliably I can't reliably get it to turn on. Uninstalling to see if another app works better.
I used to love it. .. Thought this was a great app...for the last 6months anyway.  Now I found that the app has burnt the screen of my phone So what do I do with a 899 phone I can't even sell now
Not working It keeps saying that the gps is not connected it's stop recording even though I manually turn on the gps
Takes way too much time to establish connection.
