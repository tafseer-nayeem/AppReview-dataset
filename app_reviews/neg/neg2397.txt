Downgraded, money not given back but have to repurchase. Really hope its a bug. Downgraded a few cars only to know it has to be repurchased. Why do so Before this update, this game was a solid five stars. Latest update feels like a scam and just drains down your hard earned upgrades. Downgrading and reupgrading should be flexible and free
