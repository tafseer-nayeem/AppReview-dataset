Its funny but Like it won't let me add more songs to my albums and stuff and its really confusing and I never get booked anything and I don't want to spend like 400 a week for playing songs
My song Hey how can I only make a song when the boss wants me to Why can't I make a new song alone and do the things If this happens you get 5 stars
Not what I expected How do I fine tune music in the studio. Also the court cases are stupid. I like a lot of your games but this one is the worst
storage issues had 5 million and into my 3rd yr, and could not add any more songs... I had plenty album space left I download a song and it won't even show into the game no more... uninstalled
Don't know how to find girls I can't find any Girl that can be my sim music so angry at this game
Every time I get far my screen turn white, and I have to start all over This is getting really depressing
This is the best This  sucks every time they want me to get out of debt i do it and then they say i didn't and i had to restart my career and my band
