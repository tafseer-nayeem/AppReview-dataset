Too hard too quick Stupidly hard very quickly. The easy junior version of this game is stupidly easy....no middle ground here. Annoying. Had a few months, fed up with it, uninstalling. Theres only a few levels of challenging fun.
Worst game.. I have purchased this game and I'm shocked that it won't open and force close.  This is after sending maeby crash reports and the developer hasn't responded.. Give my money  back as you guys won't rectify the problem. 
Love this BUT Its way too difficult. It needs to have different difficulty levels. I would even pay for this as a feature. If u made one level easy by having unlimited or double or triple the amount if water. If u fix this I will give five stars.
Lots of fun, but... Too many annoying bugs that prevent the game from playing. I'd be happy to submit screenshots andor explain the bugs, but there is no way to submit feedback through the game.
Not reliable On my Galaxy Tab the physics often don't do what they are supposed to which means I can't finish some levels even with a walkthrough. Quite frustrating.
Force Closes When trying to sprinkle... Pretty lame for a paid app. Please fix.
Good game but.... No new levels in over a year now
Level 6 There is n glitch on the first episode of level six. Die fire wont go out no matter how much water is pored on it. The ice cube prevents the watrr to reach the fire. Please correct this. I love the game but i cant do anything right now
