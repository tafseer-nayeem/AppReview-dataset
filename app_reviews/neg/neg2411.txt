Dont buy It doesnt work on android If you select govt .308 m80 from shooters provided ammunition profile it wont let you save the data it populated.  If you select a field to input data it only provides a telephone keypad, not a keyboard so there is no way to enter decimal points etc. Total garbage. It takes you longer than 15 min to discover this and you lose the ability to request refund in 15 min. This is basically a scam dont fall for it
I used to love Shooter  accurate info and extremely easy to use.  Unfortunately, I experienced 3 device reboot while using Shooter during a match on Sunday.  I contacted the developer on Sunday and have received no response.  I can only surmise that the developer has stopped supporting the app. 
Worked great on my iPhone Used this on my iPhone with no problems.  On my antroid it doesn't work.  Not sure if its me or the device. Everytime I open it, it starts with the settings and never does open up the tables for use.
Doesn't work on Android phones. Too late to figure it out so you can't get a refund. Don't buy if you have android phone through play store. Doesn't work. To late to get a refund by the time you input all info.
Ummm not sure.... All I have so far for 9.99 is an app that goes to a white screen. Hoping something else happens.
