Bullshit I brought premium and now I can't play at all as it keeps telling me to update to the NEW version so I click on update and it just keeps going back to the premium version which I've already purchased. Good game but a ripoff.
Wont open I paid,  downloaded then attempted to set up my account and play. It then told me to update But I had only just downloaded it and when I checked it was up to date Im not happy Shame as it looked like a good game. Please sort this and I'll rescore.
started off well... ...but now it's no real fun anymore. Random players are timing out way too often, rating isn't always according to what is published in FAQ i.e. unfair, questions get repeated too frequently and some categories are boring  many 'flag'questions for example
Stupid questions Most questions are way too hard and you get hardly any time.....
Doesn't work keeps saying needs a update but it's already updated
Not working Paid for it and it's not working. Keeps telling me I need to update it, but there is no actual update when took to the play store
I really like this game but I can't play anymore it says it needs to be updated before I can play but the update says it's not available in my country HELP please
