Update suck After update the widget colour is so ugly, I can't see clearly the event colour and the background colour can't match with it. Please change back to the previous widget theme. Else I change to other better apps. It used to help me a lot with the unique and clearly colour. But now I can't adjust it back to the original one after update.
I have a droid phone and I'm not able to do the sane things that iPhone can like the stickers on certain days.  Can u help with this
