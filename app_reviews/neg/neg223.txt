Keyboard issues Latest update changed my keyboard layout when I try to post in the Fan Feed. I don't have a Return key anymore it was replaced with a smiley key. This is because of changes in the app, it's a setting developers can change. Change it back. I don't need to use crappy smileys I need to use the return key CACODEMON34
