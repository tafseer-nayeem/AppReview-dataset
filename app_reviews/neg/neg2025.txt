Pinball pro I am rating this game because the sticks to hit it so the ball won't fall they won't move.
Technically pinball A pinball game developed by someone who had pinball described to them over a broken walkytalky. The tables available range from deeply boring to exhibiting the most anomalous, otherworldly physics imaginable. A strange, uncanny pinball app. Even compared to all the other slim pickins available on Android.
