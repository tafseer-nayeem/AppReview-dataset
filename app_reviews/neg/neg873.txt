Doesn't work It doesn't work on my phone I have the LG transpire phone. But it will work on my friends so please make it compatible with my phone
Can't get it to work Not sure what the problem is but I can't seem to make this app work for me. 
NOT FREE AT ALL  Boot up and tried to connect several times, all it wants to do is force Verizon's hotspot subscription on me  This is nonsense
Wtf It says turning on wifi but where tf is it...my family member needed it really bad and this bs didn't even connect her phone
Can't get to the button to turn it on.  Ad completely covers it.  Also no option to buy an adfree version  covered by the add as well  I'd gladly pay to remove the ad if this app works.  I can't even test it or buy that option because of the ad though.
