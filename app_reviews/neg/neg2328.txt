I. Am. About. To. Rage. Quit. So, first of all, these people need to give instructions on how to set something as your ringtone. Secondly, there are a lot of problems with that. So, when I first got the app, everything was working just fine. Then, the next day, I had a song set as my ringtone, but, in my settings, it didn't pop up. So, I tried setting it again, and, it said, Set as ringtone failed Grrrrrr Fix this and maybe I won't be so mad.
