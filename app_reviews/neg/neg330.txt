Farming really I grew up on a farm and lived in an ag community my whole life some of the animation leave you scratching your head. What is the point of having booms on the sprayer when you don't even use them
Pizzzzzzz fixxxxx It want stop shuting down...great game but it shuts down like every 3 mins fr
Need more improvement The messages should be more explicit. Sometime it's hard to identify the task that has to be done
Don't even think of downloading Totally waste of time ...poor sound.. ..hated this than any other game ever played..
Too many add's and popups Seriously make the game available for a couple of quid and ditch the overthetop ads and popups.
Needs work Cool game but needs work. Brakes , an an auto features be good. Untill then I'm uninstalling
It's fun but... Every time I go to spray the pesticides I get all the way to 100 and it won't say it's complete so I can move on. I have to complete it like 4 times before it says I do Fix it please
WHAT THE HECK When I got to the spraying level I finished but it did not repeat Did Not take me to the next level. '
The commercials come so offen i don't have time to do one thing consitently, I will no longer play because I don't want to just watch a commercial
It's ok Game could be better. More views would be great. Break and gas with forward and reverse. Harvesters steer with back tires not front. Towing the trailer needs improvement. Gate closes on the trailer. Fix these things and 5 star game
It's literally a knock off of fs 14 but with crappy graphics, with no known brands, and without a world to roam in
It's not a bad game but after everything you do an ad pops up and it gets really annoying
Sucks This game sucks hard to control don't turn sharp enough have to keep backing up to line up and freezes. Uninstalled
Fake app, never install Its not a game, its an advertising app... Every second i am getting adds one by one.. No gameapp or whatever they said is not opened at all.
