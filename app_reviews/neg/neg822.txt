Not working properly I have tried to open gallery pictures.  But it just shows a text device folders.. So uninstalling the app.  Don't know if this is the problem with my mobile model alone..
Latest update sucks It's an amazing app but after the latest update it literally takes forever to open
Sucks Too many adds and pop ups. For the effects you have to download another app it's a lie.
Worse app ever I hav never seen a dummy app like this before, no effects, no frames, no texts nothing is in this app, a garbage app
Way to many ads. Crappy app. You try to pick a photo and all you get is ads. Fix it or get delete it.
So many pop up ads cant even use it..
I would give 0 stars if that was optional When I tried to open the app, it was only at the opening screen and all it showed was more useless trash apps that I didn't even want. Therefore I couldn't even use the app I waited for 20 minutes to see if it changed screens but it didn't. It just showed the other apps.
Disgusting app When you edit your photo, its image quality gets degraded.
Nothing special I have other apps with these same settings
No efact,sticker,fram show in app Way  No show
Another clone Why so many clones of aviary
Can't open device folder for select photo
