Great idea, terrible execution I try to select let's and they rapidly toogle on and off and won't select. I have tried the stylus and my finger. This is very frustrating. I spend the entire time trying to just select one letter sometimes. Grrrrrrrrr.
Great Game....but... This game is a lot of fun and challenging but it freezes a lot Sometimes I can't play at all and it is very frustrating since I paid to have the ads removed and now I can't even play that game when I want to.
Performance Optimization Is the New Update The game just gets hung at the score of 3 or 5, Xperia Z, 4.4.2 Rooted
Great but... Buggy Played once and instantly fell in love with it but haven't been able 2 play in about a week. Wouldn't open at all, just a blank screen. Please fix so I can continue to enjoy my game. Thank you
Good game but pathetic execution I try to select one letter but they rapidly toogle on and off and won't select when using stylus. When i used finger for selection, nothing was getting selected.  Good game but pathetic execution and recognition.
Can't even play It glitches every time I hit a letter
Gets struck Good for 1 day and after it gets repeatedly  struck  nd wont respond
Crappy game I've tried playing this game on two different devices and it always locked up. Uninstalling it now.
Doesn't load It just like stays at a red screen with music playing and doesn't even start the dang game
