It's Yahtzee,  but it still blows OK I've gotten hours of free amusement from his videos,  so I don't begrudge the two bucks or whatever I spent on this 'game', and I know it intentionally sucks and that's supposed to make it funny or something,  but it just sucks.  Save your money.
Got ripped off on inapp purchase I spent a dollar for the in app purchase that's supposed to unlock 3 new characters and double had income. The dollar was added to my ATT bill and I got a receipt from Google, however nothing changed in game. Sent an email 2 days ago and didn't receive an answer.
Great game, inapp purchase fail The game is great, one of the few examples of a genuinely funny game. However I paid for the hat bonus and yet it hasn't unlocked, otherwise 5 stars
Not Worth Really fun game but it's definitely not worth the money they are asking. Everything isn't even unlocked and they are still asking me to watch ads... You could justify this whole game ad free being 1 maybe 2 but absolutely not 5
Payed extra, broke the game I quite enjoyed this game. It was fun, witty, and slightly challenging. I liked it so much I was going to throw you more money. But after paying the additional fee, the game will no longer play. It takes 3x as long to launch the main menu, and then will not display any option I selected. Please fix this, I enjoy it and want to pay more money, Yahtzee.
