 I do agree with some of the complaints. Which would be no auto play, and if i want to up my bet i have to go back to the main homescreen. If u played the other Keno apps. this one is really good, but overall 2 stars, cause it could still be better. THE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR IS FUCT UP YOU CANT HIT ANYTHING ABOVE THE 3 SPOT. IM TIRED OF DUMBASSES INCLUDING THE PEOPLE THAT VOTED AND GOT OBAMA REELECTED.
PAYOUTS ARE NOT WHAT THEY INTEND... I've noticed that when I hit a certain amount, it doesn't payout the correct amount.  That's no fun
Stealing my money I downloaded this game with the assumption that if it was going to charge my card I would get some sort of notification but instead when I run out of money in the game it automatically takes money out of my account and puts points on the game if you don't want this happening to your account after purchasing the game I would highly suggest against not downloading this scam
Stuck on installing mode. Would not install
