Doesn't wanna work I just recently reinstalled it because when I installed it the first time, it wouldn't let me in, saying unfortunately retailmenot has stopped. I was told to delete it and reinstall it. I did. Still the same thing over and over. Please fix
Old version was easy to use .this one has a print option or online code but would not show the bar code on my tablet . Why did they mess it up .also thwre is no help tab.
The only reason I'm giving a bad review is bc you require access to my photos and personal information which is none if your business.
Coupons won't load Either they won't load at all or just load without the Barcode displayed Even with a reliable connection, FIX IT
Buffering after update I use this app weekly but with the new update I haven't been able to access any stores because it only buffers
Seriously, my personal pictures I love this app, but could you explain why it needs access to my personal pictures.  REDICULOUS
Updates I downloaded the update on this ap and now it doesnt work. I even deleted the ap and redownloaded and it still doesnt work. I use to love this ap and now i cant even use it Hopefully someone can get it fixed so it is useable again... but until then.. i will find something else
