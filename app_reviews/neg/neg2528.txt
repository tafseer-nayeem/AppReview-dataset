Its good but  Only for few days after then its gonna tough to play. If u want to continue play this game u must have to Chase 200 score which is totally impossible sometime u can but it not works for every time .
200 runs Well where do i start This needs some serious attention professional players dont hit 200 runs in 20 overs and we have to do it in 10, joke.             The good players that are supposed to play for your team are in the auction and have to buy them after the first season. When you get caught in the field the fielder actually drops the ball. And theres only 2 leagues what happened to the english, Caribbean, south africa are they not big enough leagues obviously not.
Good game but has a major memory leak I can see that playing the game consumed 900 MB of wifi data in less than 20 days... This foreground usage.. Beware If your on data plan..
I just give this game 1 star  because why a buying player cannot a part of the whole tournament  Why  Why I hate it 
Fkoff Back strick is not always wicket. Also every hit is not a catch
Stick cricket This is a very good game.you want some ,take this game
