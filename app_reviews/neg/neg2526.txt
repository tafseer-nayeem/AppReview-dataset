Crap crap crap Thats all I have to say about it .crap crap crap
Too many push ads Since the update there are too many ads.  It was better before. I think i will unistall as there is nothing changed since update except more ads
Sucks butt cheeks This is a stupid game they make u start all over if u don't reach ur goal
Too many long ads Good game until one day there started being an ad between every round.   Still playable because you could close the ad immediately.  Then a few days later the ads started being 5 second or longer video ads that you couldn't immediately close.
It was fun at 1st but no real challenge Too many ads. No way to see the statistics or high score there's an option but its empty.  you're winning tickets to open up new background scenes what kind of reward is that If you at least play against other players and maybe compare scores it'd probably be worth it but this game seem as if it was made specifically for kids Uninstalling thanks
I AM GETTING A LITTLE ERITATED ABOUT ALL THOSE ADS THAT KEEP POPPING UP INBETWEEN EACH STAGE OF THE GAME, AND GOOGLE MIGHT HAVE TO REPLACE MY NEW SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB A FOR IT TOO NOW, I GET SO MAD THAT I PUNCH IT, SO THANKS ALOT, BUT NO THANKS, AT ALL FIX IT, WITH NO ADS, AND I WILL GIVE IT A 4 12 STARS, MAYBE.
That  highest scores   I thought when I play with internet connection my scores will be recorded but ugh  nothibg changed.
Why can't I make it Gosh I can't even make a 3 point cause of crap game
