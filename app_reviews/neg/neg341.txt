Good it used to be good but it's just been ruined by ads everytime someone resigns or you win or lose an ad comes up and if you want to play again you cant because an ad comes up and by the time the ad is gone they're gone so yeah. used to be a great app but just been ruined by that 1 ad the first one ain't bad it's the second one 5 stars has just turned into 2
Too much advertisement Last version was pretty good but the latest version has too much advertisement which sucks as hell. It would be good if we can save the moves for further analyses after the game
Great graphics Often have to wait to find someone online so I play against the computer most of the time. Not realistic though because when playing against the computer, it ALWAYS has to go first.  It will unexpectedly shut down or end in a draw game that counts as an automatic loss to the player as reflected in the statistics. Let the player go first sometimes and get rid of the goofy DRAW. You either win or lose, period.
Waste of time This is the worst game ever even at level 1 for single player its still like if its level 2000 ugh waste of battery and time
Good graphics.  It should have a rate system , not a winning or losing.  Also it's very bad that you can only  chose either 2 or 5 min games.  Some people are very slow and sometimes I want to play faster.  It should have the option to set the time you want. UPDATE  too much advertising  Time to look for another app
Too many adds The game was great until you became greedy and started showing ads after every game So I changed my rating from 5 stars to 1 star.
My wins are not put in but my losses are. Ive been at 100 wins for 2 months....
