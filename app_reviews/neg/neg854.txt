Not loving it I thought I could sync multiple devices since I carry different ones at times but when I export and try to import I get an error about not recognizing the file as importable. Guess I need to find something else.
Where is the scan function you promised Where is the scan receipt function that you said were coming More than half a year, still seeing no updates. Is this a abandoned app
