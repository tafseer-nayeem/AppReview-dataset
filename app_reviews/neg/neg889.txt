Not working I like this app but its not working. I'm doing everything that I'm suppose to do but it does nothing. I even tried uninstalling it and then reinstalling it and still nothing.
Old version was much better In the previous version, the characters were fluffier and had more personality. In this updated version, they look flat, the mouths barely move or move for a bit then stop. I loved the previous version and used it often in my PreK classroom for motivational messages, classroom rules, etc. I used Ginger and Tom, but my students knew them as Miss Pittypat and Buddy. I am very disappointed in this updated version. It is useless now 
Talking Tom I did not get to type my own message. The message Tom said was so fast and the speech was so bad you could not understand a word of what was said. SORRY BUT IT WAS TERRIBLE. I WILL BE UNINSTALLING TALKING TOM.
My sadness comment Actually its good n best but its records time is very short only 1 minutes . So not good for me .
Takking Tom I am having problems with this App its not recording my msgs.  It worked last wk but vid is silent when I playback.  Aby ideas  My phone Android Galaxy S5.
