Lame 5 stars for the game itself but it doesn't work with the note 4. If this is a known issue and it's a Samsung issue then reply and I'll change my rating back to 5 stars. I would like an explanation especially since I paid for this game and won't be getting a refund.
It looks like a great app but wont work on my Samsung galaxy alpha just says unfotunatly sling shot racing has stopped
Can't hate it, because I have no way reason too I have a Note 4, and it won't launch, well, launches then crashes. I was really excited to play.
Good game but But doesn't work with note 4. Wake me up when it's fixed
Refund.. Downloaded as looked fun on friends phone.. but game will not boot up or start at all
Piece of junk Do not buy if you have a note 4. Give me a refund
Force close Would give a higher rating if the game wouldn't force close every time I open it. Can't even get past the first logo
Didn't work I opened the app and I couldn't click on any thing I want a refund please
Doesn't work on Snapdragon 805 phones Doesn't work on my moto turbo and note 4 of many others. Pls fix it.
Doesn't work Doesn't even open on my Nexus 6. Emailed developers and got no response.
Doesn't work... when I try to open the app it just freezes on my screen and then crashes. Every time. Please fix or I will need my money back. BS false advertising. Fake game doesn't even work
Wish I could play this... Game continues to crash in my Note 4... Is this yet another game not optimized for the Snapdragon 805  What a waste of resources in this game. Now I can't play it... Please fix this
Does not work on Nexus 6 This was a fun game, that isn't supported on the Nexus 6.
