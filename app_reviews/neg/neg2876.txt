No longer working My daughter used to love playing this game, but since my Samsung Galaxy tab S tablet has been updated to Lollipop, this app no longer works. It starts up, gets to the splash and then crashes....please fix
Resource  Graphics heavy Very slow to load especially for a game designed for younger kids. Loading screen for each page. Graphics heavy  makes my tablet hot  causes weird glitches in the graphics and sometimes black screens. Such a shame bc my son loves this app. It's frustrating to see him want to play but can't bc something messed up.
Doesnt work I bought this and my son loved it, now my Samsung tablet is running a new version it wont open. Please fix this or refund my money
