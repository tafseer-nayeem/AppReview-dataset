Abandoned... Few months have gone by and I'm still waiting on a fix for Facebook lacking a background and the obscurely large volume panel that covers half the screen. Please fix
Still buggy Dialer Numbers unreadable.. Volume background does not scale. It's huge even if 1 slider is displaying.
No editable feature The font takes over the whole phone with no personalisation option Crazy Except from that, I liked the theme but it is impractical and an eyesore.
