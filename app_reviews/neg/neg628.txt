Won't load Was excited to play this game but when I pressed on freemode it said loading then went back to home screen. Deserves a zero star imo.
Aggressive Ads I quickly encountered 5 video adverts in the first few minutes of navigating the menus and trying out the starter car in free drive mode. There was a pulsing remove ads button in the main menu. There are also the typical small picture ads. The ingame graphics had decent textures. I drove the car around to see how it ran. It gets damaged as it collides into trees or other objects. I returned to the menu and found more video ads taking control of my screen.
Do you like ads It's the a shame, the game is actually pretty good but there is an ad everywhere, check your garage, there's an ad, pause the game, there's an ad. An ad pops up while you're driving, and there's an ad bar at the bottom, ruins a good game.
