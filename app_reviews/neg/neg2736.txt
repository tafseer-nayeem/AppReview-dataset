Not happy Amazon fire tv got controller support and so has nexus tv, but not phones or tablets and what's with the constant stuttering during game play
Cloud I love this game quite a lot. But I hate that I can't play my saved game on different devices, even though I'm signed into Google Play Games and have earned achievements For example, if I progress on my android TV, I don't have the same saved progress on my Nexus 6, I would have to start a new game...
Gamepad Gamepad works great on Android TV, but no support for gamepad on tablet. Seems like a quick fix to make this a much better experience on tablet
Won't open on nexus player, installed fine Any ideas
Freezes My game freezes after completing the waterfall in Act1 the library milkshake land. I am so disappointed after the higher cost of this game. Have emailed and will wait and see  I was enjoying it immensely until then. Such a shame.
Looked great until... This game looked great and I was really excited to play it until I downloaded it and realized that it doesn't work on my Motorola Xoom. As soon as I open it, it immediately closes and goes back to the homescreen.
