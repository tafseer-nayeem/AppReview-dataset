Nuke happy Enemy a.i's are to nuke happy it makes your generals useless and if your a smaller country you are useless please limit or remove. I understand they are real weapons of war but humans used nukes twice the npc's will use 3 per 10 turns and that's just one faction. Will rate higher if limited or removed it is a good game just to nuke happy is all.
