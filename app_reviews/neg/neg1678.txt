Worst app Doesn't do anything just asks to install other apps. Later diverts to Google navigation. No one should install this
Worst app When  I search for something, it opens google maps. I already have Google maps, then why i need to install this app.
Ad ware. . 16 pop up ads and then sends you to Google. Do you need to disable GMaps first Thats not happening. Bad programming
