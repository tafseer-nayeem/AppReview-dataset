Not impressed Don't waste your money. Thought it'd be nice to have pages with more widgets since I use them...just not appealing enough. And bring able to customize the placement of your apps on this launcher isn't all its cracked up to be either. I love this launcher but I fear I may have wasted money on the pro version
