Problems not fixed. Nexus 4 Upgrade to Android 5 brings new problems, highlights that interface has never been properly finished. Sent in screen grab some time ago, no action so I'm downgrading.
Needs Updating Used to be a great Android app. But I have a new Note 5, and there is no menu available to skip a deal during play, etc.
Not worth the money Still having problems with unresponsiveness. Online play will not work, logging in is completely inoperative.  Do not spend a dime on this software fail.
Do not buy this This app is barely worth a dollar, let alone 20. The AI for your partner makes ridiculous bids that you cannot win. Its really buggy and you have to reboot it every time you leave it because there's no way to properly close it out. Just bad, I want a refund.
It shouldn't even be offered yet.  Beta version at best Until they get an Android programmer on their team, time to fire cousin BillyBob they should not be charging for this catastrophe.   So what if it is a great Bridge program on other platforms, it is not a 20 app yet.
Latest update has ruined the app Since latest update online play doesn't work at all on my Nexus7. Previously 'advanced Acol bidding' was crap but at least online play worked although it was necessary to reboot my tablet before running the app.
No features This is a good software  on other devices. However there are no features on this app.
