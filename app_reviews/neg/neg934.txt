Freqvent crashes after last 2 or 3 updates This app is great for my 6 years son and he likes it a lot, but after the last 2 or 3 updates in constantly force closes after reading a few pages of any story. I'm running it on a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4. Please fix these issues and I will rate 5 stars
I actually love it, but it's not working On my Android phone, the home button doesnt work, so we're stuck on one story and have to kill the app and enter again to choose another story. On my tablet, it crashes the home. The music plays but the screen flashes white instead of showing the stories menu. PLEASE fix this. My kids and I love it
Please make the stories downloadable How can God's word reach every child if you assume that every parent has a fast enough internet connection. The stories are difficult to download as they are big files and they don't have resume support. Download stops in the middle and then again have to download from the beginning.
NICE Very interacting and fun for kids to know all about the bible
