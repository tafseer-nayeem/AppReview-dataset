Good Love it
Bug in the game Nuggets collected gets automatically deducted in subsequent games without even making any purchase. Seems like a glitch in the software if not done on purpose by the game makers.
Cant play There's a sign saying i won free coin come back 2moro 4 more... Its in the middle of the screen  wont go away When i press ok it takes me 2 google play 2 purchase the app...
I have think that this game beat the subway surfers but NO  sometimes, while you a playing, the game stops and then restarts and you progress is lost  i have just unistalled it  when you play, you finish a mission jump 30 times for example and the game ends, and then after restarting all is in the begining  this is not normal  sorry for may engligh, try to make a game that does not stops  I have tried it on many devices  all is the same
rail rush the new update sucks it wont let me switch tracks as soon as i get close to 300 m or 500 m it crashes
HATE HATE HATE Lag lag lag lag lag lag
