This app stinks This app made my toddler cry for hours because after she did the three thingy they wanted to make us pay to do the other 3 this app sucks do not download
Locked games Shouldn't cost
Not a free app.... Deceptive, says it's free but its so limited it's not even fun. Disappointing
Uhhh They say it's free but it is not
Man its asowme The only thing that you can do is read
Its okay... Nothing special. Too difficult to navigate.
This app sucks
Annoyingly promotes another app
