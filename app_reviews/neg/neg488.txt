I installed it and tried to download some of the free maps, but it doesn't download anything...   At first it showed me a list of maps I could download, so I selected the map for my state, and it just sat there for a very long time, trying to download the map...  So then I canceled the download, and now when I start it up, it can't even show me the list of maps any more.
Stopped updating maps Was working for months but recently stopped downloading updated maps. Cannot access map updates as page sits searching for 10 mins. Uninstalled, reinstalled and cannot access any map listing to even try downloading maps. PC version crashed when attempting to install PC version, apparently no device available for loading maps onto.
