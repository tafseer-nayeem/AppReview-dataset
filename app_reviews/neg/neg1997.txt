Tired of unbelievable fast speed, always winning player First, dont worry. You are a very  good player. Of course in a human sense. They are simple algorithms trying to simulate humans. So the rule is simple.. To play humans avoid THE robots.... There are several, Elton, Mary , Andy, Joe, Kim... They alwasy play the same... But when you feel smart enough... kick them hard
Loved this initially but since the July update I can't get past the first advertising screen Please fix this bug
Needs Private Match Making The coming soon thumbnail for the create game section has been a place holder since I purchased the game months ago... When is this option going to be available  Also, please fix game crash bugs.

Bug on Android 6.0, Blue Screen Awesome game, when it works... usually loads up to the gamechoosing screen, and then all the buttons disappear and I'm left with just the blue background.
Has been broken for a while Stopped working a long while ago...months at least. I have reinstalled and done all updates. It is just a blue screen. This same issue affects both my Verizon Ellipsis 8 tablet and my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phone.
A game you cant win, because the app always crashes the moment I could win
Full of bugs Won't even load for the majority of the time.
