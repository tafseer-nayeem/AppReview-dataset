Fastest way for perks Question if you can spend perk for tokens.. why not get perks for tokens..just a suggestion... tokens have no point really since chances of winning are almost none... Oh yea make it 5 for 1cent instead of 10 for 1. But now I'm being picky
Unfortunately,  perk has stopped working. Won't load. I just wanna play and win the darn 100 target gift card. Iflve turned phone off, on, restarted, battery out...Uninstalled game, reinstalled game... and put phone in bag of rice. Will change to 5 stars once I can play. Thank you
Help please Since Last update. After acouple of ads it stops and I just have a black screen while another ad tries to pop up. If that makes sense. Please fix.
Highly upset it made me update it in order to use the app again and now it keeps saying there are no games available try again after some time so now I can't play on the app. Fix it. Used to be awesome now it sucks. I will change its rating when it is fixed.
Way too many ads. App freezes frequently. There needs to be a way to exchange tokens for points to buy gift cards, since not everyone wants to bid on everything.
Tokens What is the point of tokens Why can't we trade tokens for perk points It would make the app a lot more fun
Won't Load Every time I open the app it says games are not available try after some time I have waited two days and it has not changed please fix.
Really Uninstalling if it won't go off the screen to try again at another time lol.  Will change review if it gets fixed.
Hmmmm was great After latest update the app wont load, very upset please fix this issue
Please fix update It was working great before latest update. Please fix.
Too many video ads There are way too many video ads, my boyfriend who also plays only gets still ads.
Freezes After I win instead of going to an ad it just freezes and I have to exit out of the whole game to play. Getting annoying.
