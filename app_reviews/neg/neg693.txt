Fun but limited. It is fun originally but you hit a wall quickly, can not have any shaking your head etc. Also can not make talking movements or any other updown things without displacing body. Please fix if possible. Major problem is not being able to change background or move things fluidly, an option to shut off the auto scene creating option at certain points would make this program workable, and a pc version
It alright It ok everything right but the voice record is mess up yall need to fix that for the new update
It restarted It deleted my progress
