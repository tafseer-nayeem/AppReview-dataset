Doesn't work with Lenovo S5000 Original post October 2014 Contacted support NUMEROUS TIMES, they have yet to respond AT ALL  update 11172015  Still a piece of junk Worked for a couple days, now crashes to background as soon as page loads. The fails would make me miss ads if I were buying ... Just saying  no clicks, no revenue. Fix the problem
I didn't like it I didn't like it bcuz when I tried calling someone it said its a number we don't support
Can't send or receive videos Please make a update to send and receive high quality videos
Update app now unable to textcall Keep getting error that text can't be sent message click retry and same error coming back for same reason.HELP
Wat Won't let me exit
Ever since the update it won't send ANY texts. I can call and receive texts but I can't send any
Can't make calls It won't let me make calls because it doesn't call from the app, but trying to call from my phone's network. I only use this particular phone for WiFi and it isn't on. I have minutes going to waste because it won't let me call  out.
Sucks
this aplicasion this super heavy ads go too often fix that                      No esta mala pero desde que le hisieron el update nadamas que la tocas constante mente salen anunsios y es super fastidioso hagan una mejora con eso
Used to love it Since the update there is no more touchtone. So anytime I am on a telephony menu none of the number buttons do anything. What is the point of using the app now
This app no longer works after the update. The screen just keeps flickering and causes my phone to freeze
So was able to register but when I am asked to enter my card  can't even enter or say and it just hangs up...
Every time i try to watch a video and get mintues and they wont give me my mintues stupid
