Don't throw money on this, it's sucks.. This app Sucks l have regreted buying it. I urge no one buying it. It has helped me run a traffic camera and also got ticket for speeding. It has no voice feed back and can't detect any reader. Don't download it even if it is for free to occupy a space on your phone. There are better ones out there please take time to look for one.
