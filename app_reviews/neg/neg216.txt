Terrible app to be honest. The app only had 1 location out of 13 I needed. The app shut itself down randomly. The buttons do not always work, you have to click constantly to pick your state. The way the app is set up would be good, but there are way to many errors.
Not really sure what wrong
Junk I live in the grait basin of vernal UTAH. i would put in my location in town were i  needed to go to then it would pop up on the screen no problom then showed me how to get there no problom. But when i needed to go to my next well location affter my first location it would not take me there not cool  it only works If i have cell service WTF what a scam
Typed in several locations and it don't come up Not good
What the heck Worked fine for a month or two now I can't seem to search for any wells keeps telling me to simplify my search. Need to update it or something
Android app Didn't work doesn't even find the wells in odessa tx
THIS APP IS CRAP...I PAYED 15 N TRIED TO GET MONEY BACK N THEY SAID I COULDN'T GET IT BACK,,,APP ISN'T WORTH THE MONEY
Not worth the money Doesn't bring up most of the Wells in w. Texas some but not most in which it should especially after purchasing two more updates
Not for my location Don't locate hardly any wells in Wheeler TX
No good Could not get the right location to the well I needed
Works horrible on android I updated the app on Android only because I updated my iPhone and the update is not compatible with well nav, the android version is horrific. Please hurry and fix this app to be compatible with the iPhone update.
Don't waste your time for android Doesn't work properly, won't find wells.
