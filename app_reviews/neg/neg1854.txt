Crashes after purchasing new chapters Trying to find a solution, but after purchasing the new episodes it stops around 45 and says there is an error downloading the content and crashes. Terrible since I paid 15 for the season pass.
Season pass disappeared I tried to email the customer service and the email is not real. Great game but i paid 15 and now they want me to pay it again.
Crashed Play was stuttering to begin with and then it crashed and took my tablet with it. Two hourx later I managed to get the tablet to reset and now I'm to scared to run the game again. Glad I didn't splash out on the season pass. Very disappointed with this as I love borderlands and telltale games.
CANT DOWNLOAD PART 2 brought the second episode tried like 8 time to download gets to like 26 and it says server timed out it says partially downloaded when I select resume download it starts again from the beginning then 26 stops fix it
Crashes The game works perfectly at the main menu, then crashes when loading an episode. I feel like ive wasted my money
Shame I really wanted to play this but since I downloaded ep 2 now the game won't start period I want a refund.
GREAT GAME BUT DOESNT START Purchased the season pass but kept crashing after episode 3...reinstalled app but now it doesn't even start gets up to updating dlc content and then crashes emailed no response..no fix disappointed
