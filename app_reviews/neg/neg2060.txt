Hustler App you can still get the work
After recent update, I lost all my coins and bikes smh....
When i press the game it go back home
Its fun but none of the numbers add up. I can score 800 and it'll only give me 400. The last round I played I had a 4x bonus and I scored 700 so I should have got 2800 but it gave me 1400. Idk if its on purpose or just a glitch. If its on purpose I'm deleting the game. I would really like a reply please
