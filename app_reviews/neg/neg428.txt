Rubbish Doesn't record work out. Distance zero time over an hour. Very demoralising.
Was Good But No Longer Works Properly Always worked well in the past but just recently it does not log any distance. It will show my exact location and movements on the map, the timer will start but the distance stays 0km. I have tried all the suggestions, updated the app, checked gps with other apps, restarted my phone and enabled and disabled the gps several times. Time to look for a new app, I think.
No live tracking without expensive membership Isn't that the entire point I've used mapmyrun for years, now. GPS is the only real reason I would want this app and it was a free feature until Under Armor got its greedy little hand on it.  There are a million run tracking apps just like this. I guess that's how it goes with mobile apps. You make it to the top just to sell out to a larger company, then they drive it back down to the bottom.
Horrible GPS Did I run 3 miles, or did I run 6  I've received those distances for the same route.  Thanks for thinking I'm a wizard and can Dumbledore through solid walls, but I really can't even if your app thinks I can.
Crappy GPS How is it that this app will tell me I have run x distance at the point I turn around and yet the total distance is not 2x when I follow the same route an return to the same point.
Its an okay app. I am upset that i just upgraded the app for the sole reason of the interval training and then the interval training will not let you input seconds, only minutes. I'm about to cancel my anual membership and find a different app unless they can fix this
