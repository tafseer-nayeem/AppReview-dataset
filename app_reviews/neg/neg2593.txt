Absolutely poor If my king is at check , I'm trying to move my rook to eliminate the opponent's rook that's causing the check but I'm not able to. I can only move the king it seems. Really irritating and pathetic.
Better and sensible app available compared to this I fing uninstalled it. Its understood that a good app is provided for free and so you need to post ads on ur app. So it doesnt mean you shud force people to play store to download an app by your ads. Its completely bullshit. You are stoning yourself this way to ur death. Improve while u can.
