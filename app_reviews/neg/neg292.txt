Requires Gems Logging in for a week can get you two Gems a day, but the game likes to randomly reset the day counter. There is a Casino that only rarely pays out a pitiful amount of Gems and a 24 hour instead of daily limit on coin rewards.
Too pricey I really liked this game at first but you need too many gems to buy anything. Nice way to force people to spend real money. Just spent 40k in the casino and no gems won Bit of a rip off am gradually getting bored of this game as unable to proceed without spending actual money to purchase diamonds
No just stop I hate how you need so many diamonds to upgrade one thing, like wtf Stop ruining a good game with your greedy money hungry minds
Updated versions are still hard cost too much money. You need gems to buy restaurants, and update your equipment but way too hard to get gems. Spend a lot of           money to get gems. in casino you  lose all your money to get gems.. No good need to change that it's no fun
So Glitchy Fix the problem where you tell me I'll get free in game coins for downloading something or whatever, but then I never get them. EDIT After playing a little further I've found that this game is ridiculously glitchy. Some of the table top space refuses to work, cannot be accessed after placing an object on it. I hate the gem system on the game, though I understand that purchase of gems is what generates money for the developer.
