Doesn't move
No sound, do not buy. Paid for this app, No sound. Horrible.
Doesn't work well The pictures have no movement  when you post them to Facebook.
Doesn't Work Don't buy this app. I installed an update and it crashes doesn't even work.
Kind of boring. No sound. No option to comment on a Facebook post. Need more features. Give it the ability to be added as a keyboard feature and I'd give it more stars.
The animated version did not do what it was suppose to do, it just showed the picture
No sound it sucks a 1.00 wasted
