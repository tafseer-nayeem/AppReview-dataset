 Its sad how they get the words wrong , if you listen to the song and then play it and it looks different.
maybe I'm just being harsh, I'm a Nicki Minaj fan though. I'm clearly wanting to kill time, but it was annoying how wrong the lyrics to ONLY are, not to get into detail with other songs. plus the way some words are the answer twice cus that messes me up. lol. but should it really be called Nicki Minaj song quiz cus songs like Bang Bang  She Came To Give It To You aren't even quizzing you on her verse.
List empty I downloaded this on my android phone and no songs will pop up and in the video It says there's puzzles waiting  to be solved nope there isn't anything to play.
