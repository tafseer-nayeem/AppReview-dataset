Meh Not really impressed. It would be better if there is a search engine on there to allow me to find a specific article.
Stay far away First app I purchased that doesn't work on my Nexus 10. Data would never load. Piece of junk...not unlike the military command.
Story selection I have never been routed to the story selected. Only the story before or after. When swiping to the story I wish to read often times all I get is a white screen.
fubar yet. You have to tap the story above the one you really wanna read to see it. when you tap see more of a story and try to share one on Facebook you get sent back to the story like  nothing happened. i couldn't even log in to fb. Idk. Its messed up with alot of bugs.
Not very good on a tablet Works well enough. BBC app is better, more sophisticated,  easier to use. This app is too plain. I prefer the pdf version.
Won't load on my phone. Disappointed won't load on my galaxy 4 note.
Crash This app doesn't work at all. The app crashes every time I open it and I haven't been able to use it at all.
Once functional, not so much now. Completely stopped working.  Articles will no longer load or refresh...even even after uninstall, reboot, reinstall worthless now
Doesn't refresh Won't refresh. Loved the app for the two days it worked. I've hit refresh every day and still stuck on 29 Dec
Won't install
It is the worst reflection of the Stars  Stipes paper I am trying to get my money back for his app.  It is useless.  All the great things that the Stars  Stripe paper both paper back and electronic version had to offer have been stripped out of this  poor representation app. Please remove it from the app store and put the electronic version back on the internet until you can create a product that is worthy of this great papers name.
