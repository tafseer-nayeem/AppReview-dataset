Bad compared to the other comixology apps The Marvel Comixology app is awesome. The regular comixology app is great, too. The DC comixology app is horrible. Slow loading. Mixes up comics. Bad searching. Bad overall.
Works good but marvel app is better Marvel has the ability to run your downloaded comic without Internet access.  This is fusstrating that it's using my data for something I apparently downloaded. Also hate the constant signing in.
Genius Nice one DC, you cannot use yahoo or gmail addresses via the app to register. Smart move to block two of the most popular email accounts in the world
how about directly using extSdCard I really wish that this app fully supported keeping all downloads and libraries on the extSdCard of my Samsung GS4, where I have an underutilized 80MBsec ExtremeSD card. where in the heck is my TheDeathofSuperman
Really bad Can not register with either gmail or hotmail.
I try to put my email in and it won't load what is up with that
Terrible App Bought 15 worth of comics and can't read a single one of them. Customer Service response is nonexistent.
None of my books download all the way
