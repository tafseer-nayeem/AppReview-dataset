Word crack This sucks  It was okay to begin with and now it won't count words that I try to use.  I know they are words.  Things like sword, like, soar, envy. .....if it doesn't get fixed I will remove it and tell everyone I know not to even bother
Word Crack This is the BESTword game on the computer. So why only one star I played constantly UNTIL the   board would not change  reinstall did no good.  According to comments, people seem to be giving up on this.  Fix this glitch, and you'll have the winner you should.
Have a note3  and it gets stuck on a loading screen then when you back out it freezes and turns into a strobe light. If you chose to use a coin on something and this happens everyother turn you do not get it back. Fix before you give someone a seizure and have a law suit on your hands. Fun game if it worked correctly.
Not as good as word streak The main issue is the sensitivity when trying to drag finger diagonally. Too often it hits letters I don't want.
this game sucks.  when you get to the higher levels it cheats and says the words that you are seeing are not really words.  MAN  they say not a word.  RUI not a word.  there are lots of them.  I even used a booster and it did the same thing with the words it gave me to use.  I I had not already used them as I hit the boost as soon as the board came up.  very very disappointed.
So sad Love this game but it crashes after the ending of my first game. ..then in takes 30 min to hr before I can play again.  Hopefully gets fixed soon
Word Crack Addicting and fun. Would have given 5 stars but game crashes every time a word is constructed of 7 letters or more which prevents good scores and words. It's very aggravating Now even more bugs with only one practice board. I believe the problems that do not get fixed make the game more aggravating than fun. If everything worked or at least worked on, it would be a great game. I won't continue playing until fixes are made, if ever
