Freeze After the recent update.the game always freeze when I want to click on life given by friends Now the game totally can't restart.Pls look into this or I goona uninstall soon
freeze It constantly asks to use a picture but once you select one it just freezes the whole game. And if you close out you can only make it one level before it happens all over again. Such a waste of time
Fun game but none of my friends play and I'm not waiting 3 days to unlock a set of boards. So have to delete
Wont work Loved playing this game but since the last update it now wont work. So disappointed. Please sort it quickly
Can't connect to server I love the game still play it but I can't connect to Facebook. Don't understand how to solve this problem
Great game but the freezing. .. I really enjoy the game but when it asks me to upload a photo the game freezes there. I have to restart to get passed it but it comes back when I advance to the next level
Freezing issue Since the last app update, the game will freeze while loading.
