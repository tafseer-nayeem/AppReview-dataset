NO ALERTS I've had this app for 2 years I rarely get notifications. I'm currently sitting in the middle of a thunderstorm with heavy rain.... NO ALERT We lost satellite, but NO ALERT
Doesn't work.... So far it doesn't do anything but search for local partners....   Monsoon storms in the area right now and this app that I actually paid for does nothing.   Don't waste your money  I live on the edge of Metro Phoenix so I would think that something in the area should sync up  Have tried shutting app and re opening and still same lame result
Storm Shield I have the purchased edition. I get up this morning and it tells me that I have to purchase it to make it work any longer  How many times do I have to buy it  Get my app to working again 
Frustrated I have the location set and yet I get notified for weather more than 50 mile away from me and never get notified about the weather in my actual location. About to demand a refund for this crap, uninstall and go back to WeatherBug.
Waste It no longer works. I haven't had a notification in almost a year.
Worked very in consistently. Uninstalled and reinstalled numerous times, now it cannot find my location. WTF
Worst weather app. The radar stops working, alerts come long after I get them from other apps.  And, the other apps are FREE.  Waste of money.
Great until recent update Loved it until latest update now I can't watch the live streaming video. I've made sure I don't need to update my android, uninstalled, etc. 
Not helpful in any way
No alerts I receive no alerts.  Extremely surprised because I had this app on ios and it was awesome switched to Android and absolutely no alerts whatsoever super bummed.
Doesn't work well Does not allow you to move the pin once it is placed. Also doesn't give accurate forecasts for remote locations.
