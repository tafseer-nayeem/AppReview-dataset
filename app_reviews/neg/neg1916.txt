Its shit... You have to pay to see who likes you and only ger limited messages.  Now its harder to talkmeet a partner than real life... badoo sucks. Go out and get drunk and talk to ppl 
Every all purchase credits What do only one purchase.
Ripped off, what did I pay for
Garbage Don't use this app
Pictures are not showing
Dont even bother
G4 What a con no different than the free version, oh apart from superpowers for one week, save your doe and go for the free version...
They keep dragging you to pay more and more plus you can not chat freely even if you pay unless you keep verify your whole family details
I didn't get,the 1 week super power offer... do I have to pay money twice ... u guys are cheating people..
What's the point of calling it premium when you gotta buy more stuff to use the app flipping con
