Horrible La peor aplicacin del mundo anda mal hay  que pagar por todo y en las canciones el 80 de las veces las notas no te las reconoce siendo que tocas bien fuerte y cerca como para que se escuche malisima
Your app is deaf Seems like a good app until you try to play and it says it can't hear you.  Uninstalled
ATTENTION This app really does teach you to learn guitar but they pop up adds every other minute of how you should upgrade to the pro version which is bull crap because I can never learn anything with the 1 million plus adds but other than that this app is probably the best out there
It would be good... Except the app is deaf and only picks up the notes you play half the time if you turn off the app volume, sit in a quiet room, and pluck the strings absurdly hard. Then it MIGHT hear you and stop asking you to plug into an amp. Not even a setting available to adjust sensitivity...
SUPER DISAPPOINTING  I was Soooooo excited to play and learn. I can't even get past the tutorial without it freezing up. I've tried closing and reloading over 15 times hoping to get past the glitch. I even reinstalled it but the same thing happens.... Very poor to say how great your app is when ppl can't even play it. Fix this issue so I can try it and maybe I'll give it 5 stars.  Maybe if I even like it that much I'll pay for it.....
READ Don't waste your money this app is junk if you really want a cheap effective fun way of learning how to play guitar just buy Rocksmith it is that simple and it is way cheaper too
This broke my string I wennt to the tuner and tried to tone it, it kept saying the string was low... And then I put it to high and it broke UGHHH
Horrible Don't install the app.                                    It does not even open without Internet
Confusing I don't know where I'm suppose to put my fingers.
