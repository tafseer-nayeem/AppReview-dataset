Force Close During StartUp Its bad, pay for the apps but can't use this. This game force close during start up. Please fix it because i pay the apps.
Still freezes Love the game itself but when i go to beat pops for the second time it freezes on the kill shot. I sent an email to the developers and recived nothing back. If this scam isn't fixed soon I'll have to find a way to get a refund.
Loved it but please make it longer. And start to work when  I'm about to beat Level 30
Crashing on Nexus 5 Can't get passed the tutorial. It keeps crashing. Also it get pretty large too. Hopefully they patch it up, looks fun
Serious freeze problems... I've had it for about 5 hours and it's froze up on me around 14 times. Which sucks because it's a pretty solid game..
Doesn't work I go to play it and it does back to the home screen
Can't even play it Lags so much that it ends up force closing on Nexus6
Won't let me play It's says that it has stopped
