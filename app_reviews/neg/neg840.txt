 I dont like this app at all... it wont work for me its just bad. no offense though.
Terrible app, plus to many popup ads.
Not usable Unusable. Way too many adds and crashes every single time I select a photo from my gallery. Uninstalled
TERRIBLE APP. It only has four mirroring options, none of which are anything like the photos displayed here. Not to mention that the buttons are so tiny that it takes you twenty tries to press between the four measly options. I was not impressed at all.
