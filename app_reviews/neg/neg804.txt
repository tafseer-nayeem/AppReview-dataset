Manual Zoom Replaced Pinch to zoom is nice for some but what if you want a zoom lever I want my zoom like it was. Where is this option
API are not working on Galaxy S6 I guess the advanced features regarding the new camera2 api are not working on new exynos devices
Way too buggy Was a good app at one point, but now it's crazy buggy. Switching from one photo function to another results in green lines all over the screen and it goes haywire. Switching to video is even worse.
Nagged to install editor repeatedly. I don't want it Recently tried a competitor and had a better experience.
Can't open on my MI4
Manual mode Does it had manual mode for galaxy s6 edge If not I will proceed with a refund.
Love the functionality Love the added functionality over the stock camera app on my Nexus 6. I especially like the addition of Camera 2 API support, the cameravideo toggle button implementation, and the ability to pauseresume video. AutoFocus doesn't take most of the time unless I rapidly tap on the AF button that needs to be fixed. I've encountered jpeg corruption with the last update rendering it unusable.
