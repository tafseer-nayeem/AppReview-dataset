junk didnt work right outa the box. If it uses the letters Noaa,Id suggest staying away from it. there was no radar or forcast available for my location in Key West and when I typed in Naval air station boca chica. Popup no such place Radar Now has it as a station. What the hell. This crap aint working with android 4.0.4 ics. Im dumping it now with a gracious 1star rating.
