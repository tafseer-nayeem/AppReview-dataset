No Encryption Granted, Kostya doesn't advertise the feature, but I was very disappointed to read that he has been asked by several paid users to include it, has responded rather flippantly.  Now that I need it too, I know there's no point in asking.  Back to K9.
Not Good I don't get email notifications even after enabling it in the options. The emails don't get downloaded over wifi  mobile network. Error while email synchronisation.
Buggy Does not sync, widget does not update and even smart folder misses displaying emails from all accounts so I end up missing emails.

Doesn't removedelete emails Have app set to purgedelete immediately but still won't. Why did I even pay for this nonsense. Not worth the cost.
Battery Good app but now catastrophic power drain. Why
Stopped working  wasting my time Used it for a long time but it won't send and has wasted a LOT of time without any success. And I can't find effective help anywhere on line.
