Doesn't work on my Note 3 My 4 yr old kid loves this game on all of my other devices, but for some reason it doesn't work on my Note 3. 
Hate it so much Oh my gosh this game is so creepy it gave me nightmares.I uninstalled right away.I say it was just a waist of money. Do not buy and even if it doesn't creep you out if your a girl you totally come out looking like a creepo weirdo ugly man

Force closes Force closes and black screen on my Galaxy Tab 10.1... Please fix it I happily paid 2.99 for it and it's unplayable.
Keeps crashing If anyone could suggest a solution on how to fix the constant crash, that'd be great. If not, I want my money back
Was good at first Was good at first then it just stopped responding all the time it never worked.
Racist This game is very racist and makes me have black skin when I'm really a white British. This game needs help. Racism is terrible
Wouldn't install  on tablet or SD card is the message I keep getting with no  explanation  not a informative app

Took my money but won't install Paid for the app but it says unable to install. And now it won't give me the option for a refund
