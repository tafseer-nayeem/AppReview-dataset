90 Days and No Update App will not work with Android 5.1.1. It's been 90 Days since my last review and it still doesn't work. Please don't waste your money.  I am running a stock Nexus device and it won't even open. The July 7th update did nothing. Developer clearly only care about ios and not Android.
