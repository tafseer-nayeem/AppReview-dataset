The lists were fine before Absolutely hate this swipe right  go back thing they added to list viewing. If I swipe with any angle it'll close the list I'm viewing and kick me back to the list menu. I can't see how this feature would be useful to anyone and it has made this app a huge hassle for me to use.
After update After the new update Its not giving me the option to to use transparent in the settings
Meh Meh meh meh meeeeeh
Doesn't work on Android 6.0 It's very slow to authorize and when it does I can't scroll my feed can't back out of the appcan only exit by hitting home takes several tries to get into settings and no changes to setting make a difference... I did a little trouble shooting and it's the location access if that's off the app doesn't work with it on its perfect.
Automatic night mode doesn't seem to be working.
