Kitchen test before serving The app is awesome, beware the recipes. While I have made only two so far, both needed additions to be worthwhile.
Nice app, little Content The app looks great and is well designed. Unfortunately there is very little content. Yes, there are 180 recipes, but over 100 of those are just soups, sides, and condiments. If you want ideas for actual meals, don't waste 5 on this.
No nutritional values No links to the various FOK recipes Can only use the recipe shopping feature for currently listed recipes  Costs too much for what it does  can access great food infoideas for free from FB
Not worth paying for Who needs a recipe to put blueberries cinnamon or almond milk on your oatmeal.  The recipes are incomplete steps missing or unnecessary see above.  There are very few recipes here, most of which are sauces.  Maybe that's to hide the flavor of otherwise flavorless food.  Will keep looking.  Waste of money here.

Huh I just bought this and can't open it up Help
