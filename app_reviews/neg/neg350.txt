Grrrr This game reverts me back to a previous save constantly.its usually 100 stages but once it was 200 stages. I emailed the developers but they didnt answer. Dont waste your time.
Can't load save game I transferred phone and now i cant load my account. It always says that i need to sign in to google play services even if i already did. Will rate 5 stars if my issue will be resolved.
Can't get past the load screen without a force close, so upon actually being able to try said game, I can't say if it's worth downloading or not, with the inability to play, it currently is just taking up room
I had several upgraded relics and hero items I bought with diamonds and out of nowhere the game reverts to a very previous save file and now I'm totally screwed.
Game freezes whenever I try to replay after going to a different app and try to reopen it. Also freezes during all fairy ads.
Absolutely love the game but the data usage... This game is awesome except for the fact that data is constantly being used. In a few days it used 60MB of data I refused all ads And on WiFi I watched ads it used 877MB It's not just my phone because this happens on my tablet, too. This is one of my favourite games, but until this is corrected, I cannot play this or recommend it to anyone.
Suck Erm....can just enable us to HV our skills CD done when we're offlineand wht I just join a tournament within 7minute alreaf6 gt PPL reach 7klevelWTF
Downloaded the game now but I don't know why the game is stuck at the loading screen. Tried reinstalling it but the problem still persists. Note that this is my first time to play the game. It's just stuck at the loading screen, help please
