The game is wack It's way too simple even for a kid and has too many ads and also want u to play the mini games to get gems.. and also it's like you do the same things in each level everyone has the same problem in an accident

Bad Stupid game for babies and if it is for kids why is it called pregnant emergency doctor just why my sister is the one who has it so she is only 6 and she says I is stupid so re make it. It is garbage
Don't download Too many ads I don't like it. And I am not gonna sit up here a buy a freaking no ad for a game that I might not even play for a long time. You guys are a rip off
UTTER DISGRACE I ONLY DOWNLOADED IT SO I COULD COMMENT.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME.  AS A FATHER OF TWO CHILDREN, ONE VIA AN EMERGENCY C SECTION THIS GAME IS TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE AND SHOULD NOT BE ON THE PLAY STORE.
Couldn't even complete level 2 because I did not have any more gems and without purchasing them,  no way of earning them
Bad game all it does I show pregnant women with injuries that you have to give first aid to it had no education aspect to it and no kind of reward for the user to make them feel as if they are helping the Mummy. total waste of time and lacking in effort by the makers
What big al kirk said This game is hut gay all you do is oh put bandages on a person you dont even do sergery like wth
Eh Its glitchy but cool
I hate this game because it do not unlock all the state and some of them is for 40 do not download this game
To everyone This game is the worst game ever never play it unless you liked to be borde
Horable I hate this game because it says newborn baby but you don't give birth. They have to get this game fixed
