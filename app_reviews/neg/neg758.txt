Im really disappointed Bought the paid version hoping it worked. Won't show agenda in calendar agenda view,  can't get it in colored versions as above... Doesn't sinc at all...uninstalling 
Sucks Can't get it to work with any calendar. ..it says it works best with Google calendar. .I downloaded that and I still can't get it to work.  I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE And to think I paid for the damned key  Domeone shoot me please
