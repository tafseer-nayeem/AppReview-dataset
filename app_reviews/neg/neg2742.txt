Not playable. Super small map. If you fly to high or too low you will loose the islands forever. There is a map, but it's no help.
Eh Controls are bad and the Dragon is way too big and fast for such a tiny map. There should be an Instant land option because it's too hard to land. Good Dragon graphics but thats basically all I liked
Terrible. Poorly planned. Poorly designed. Complete ripoff. Spawn and die. Useless controls. Instant deaths. Inability to land and fight. Impotent attacks. Not worth spending the time to even learn to play  worthless game
