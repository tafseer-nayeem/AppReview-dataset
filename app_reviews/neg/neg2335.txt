Worst game ever I tried this game once and the notes were so short and terrible. It sounded awful. Don't waste your time with this because it just isn't worth it.
I PLAY THE PIANO, I AM NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS APP,I PERSONALY THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A HIGH TECH  , BUT I WAS UP FOR A BIG, SUPRISE, IT IS REALLY SLOW AND TAKES A SECOND TO EVEN PLAY A NOTE, SO I PERSONALY  THING THIS IS A WASTE.
Woah I love how people put effert into this game but... this piano is not good at all you half to hold the keys to even make a sound plus it auto scrolls its like the sonic free riders connect for pianos
