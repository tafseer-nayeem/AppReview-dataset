Developers never respond. Had since 92711 had issues all the time never heard back from developers.    Update 12114   Started using again after going from evo  iphone  galaxy  s4. Scanner no longer available on galaxy s4.  Again no reply from developer.   As you can see from previous comments.  They never seem to reply or update the app.
Can not back up and restore I spent days and hours putting in everything in my pantry and my freezer. I did do a backup. Then I had to replace my samsung galaxy note 2 under warranty.  New phone  came with 4.3 which does not permit me to download the free version of my pantry. In order to get your backup you have to have the free version and the paid version in order to restore your back up.  I'm stuck with days and hours worth and nothing to show for it.
Dana M My main menu screen shows 6 boxes with no text. There are no indicators as to what the boxes lead me to. Mine looks nothing like the screen shots advertised.
Was OK but now doesn't work App was workable with a few glitches but I needed to reinstall on a new phone and the buttons disappeared as with my data that was supposedly backed up.
Hoping for more I was very excited to use this with the my pantry option and scanner but blah very disappointed everything I scanned was not found  Big waste of time for me.
Don't Work The main list page didn't have the words, just empty boxes. Couldn't get it to scan bar codes and put in pantry.
great but.... I enjoyed the app, so I bought it, now I can not use it.  I recently got a new S3 and now it tells me this.... 'This app is incompatible with your S3'
