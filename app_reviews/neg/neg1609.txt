I really need a alarm. I got figured out the charger part but still doesn't work. It's so late . I pick it up no alarm. I have 2 locks on my phone and unlock both still no sound. About 1 minute later then it goes off  I mostly need it for work. Anyone can take it or pick it up. All that works is the picture. Like yeah cool but he's probably out of town by now.
