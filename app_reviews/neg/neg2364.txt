Immediate support needed Though its my fav game but it says Could not be downloaded due to error 492 Now what to do I have paid for this game.. Before I played after  factory reset of my mobile now I am not being able to download this game...
Still sucks ...after 8 months I installed this ...game, again, to discover that you still did not properly fix the steering. Good job
Good but It was good on my s2, great on my s4, great on my g4...  I was excited to install it on my Android TV Box but all it does is flash black and grey... BROKEN
WTF Happen The game was working just fine, until this recent update. I got the two new challenges but now I don't have any music or SOUND for that matter AT AllUpdate Sound glitch still an problem but after finishing one race then the sound comes back.Update Audio glitch is gone,still has long load times though.Update Game won't load at all constant screen flickering, unusable.
WTF I paid for and put days and days of work into this game the today when I get on it The game force closes and the resets all of my work..uninstall
Does not connect with my controller I bought a Moga Hero Power, and this game will not read it.
 Won't work on s5
A true showing that Gameloft does not care about customers. I have installed this on many different devices over the years and its nice to see that of all of the problem reports over the years specifically the Iotto, meant nothing. As I just installed on my new phone after not playing for a long time and still not fixed.
