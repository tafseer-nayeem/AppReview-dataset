Timer is damned annoying Uninstalled it, please give option to turn that distracting garbage off. Could be a good game, no idea bc of that moronic timer
Waste of time.Bogus.Nonsense. Bombarded with adds.Did not even let me play.UNINSTALLING.
Seriously Every time I finish a puzzle, the screen goes black completely aside from the ads.  It doesn't turn back to anything usable until I exit the app, as soon as I reopen the app the screen is black again,  I actually have to turn off the app and restart it.  Utter waste of time
