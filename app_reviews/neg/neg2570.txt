Awful lag Ok so i had this game on my ipod 5 and I loved it. I got a galaxy s4 and just had to download this game again. On my ipod it was very smooth operation but on my galaxy it has major lag. I Uninstalled alot of game to open up memory. I disabled quite a few apps to boost my phone. Nothing has helped. If you can fox the lag then I'll be more than happy to rate 5 stars and continue playing.
