Lot of issues Lot of bugs,I am a pro customer facing lot of issues,app is not behaving as pro moreover bugs are not fixing by developers,app is not autostarting but once manually started its uses are good but better to avoid and go for better one's.
I have to manually enable the app, even though i already set it to auto. Such a hassle Using galaxy s5, 5.1.1
The app is good but its buggy Whenever I am trying to install any 3rd party app on my nexus 5marshmallow, it doesn't allow me to click on the install button.  But the moment I stop or pause and try to click on install ,it works.  It's having a bug and I am really surprised that how can only that part didn't works and also hugely disappointed that there is such a stupid bug on a paid app.
Native Android interface buttons do not change colour Native Android interface buttons 'back', 'home', 'tasks list' do not change their colour, so you have red display, but buttons quite irritate your eyes with higher brightness and the whole point of the app is lost.
Amazing app, but it won't stay running. I always have to open the app manually to make sure it runs. I know it's meant to stay on, but it won't. I have a Galaxy Note 4 with Android Lollipop.
Android's backlight controls not working anymore I regret using this app I even bought the pro version, given that I'm no longer capable of adjusting the backlight of my device using Android's backlight controls. The worst thing is that they don't work anymore, even when I uninstalled both apps Twilight, and Pro key. HELP
