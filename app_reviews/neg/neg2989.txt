Not worth paying for. My 3 yr old was bored with this is within 15 min.  Only 4 games that are repeated over and over which are too simple for a 3 yr old.  Very little to to nothing with animation, voice is irritating.  If this had been a free download it would still  be uninstalled.  Big waste of money.
Black screen Audio works, cannot see anything though. any way to fix android 4
Won't work Sound but no picture, realised too late for a refund
It's on my phone. Wont even work. My kids are bored with it. Work on my galaxy tab
Just the same thing over and over. Too over stimulating.  Would not consider this an educational game at all. Toca boca has much better learning games
Cannot  install Can not install on Galaxy  Tab 4. Looked for the APK trying to fix it but can't  find one.
Not Worth 1.99 Repetitive, twitchy, and too easy for a two year old.
Can not install on galaxy tab 4 7.0
Cant install Give my money back It cant install at all
Wont install on galaxy tab 4
Waste of money Only 3 or 4 games repeated over and over, and don't get any more difficult. Should be free.
