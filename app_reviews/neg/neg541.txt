Nothing special It's essentially a fancy way of viewing tables and fixtures and schedules. No notifications or even real time score updates. Piece of poop.
LOUSY Why are scores not updated Costa Rica Vs Jamaica is been over and still shows like it hasn't been played. Click on it gives tomorrow's time. So is the El Salvador Vs. Canada match. Plus no videos, no updates no live feeds.... this App kinda sucks
Doesn't update App essentially stopped working after semifinals.  No update with information about final match or third place match.  Pointless app, actually, from now own I'll just create a bookmark instead of installing an app which doesn't work.
I guess it's impossible to make a simple app If it were truly free, I'd give a higher rating, but you have to sit through timed ads to experience this app, and it just doesn't cut it. It tells you the scores, but is also has a nonintuitive interface, and no knockout grid.
Sucks Scores are not updated live... never any videos of the goals...uninstalling
No live scores, wrong dates for matchday, wrong times for matches.
Not Good They dont have the right score, not good at all
needs more You need to add where the soccer games will take place and the name of the stadium, needs some more improvement
Error Try again. Error loading.
Not working App not working at all, the Jamaica vs Costa Rica game is 15 minutes in and the app is still showing tomorrow with nothing live. Galaxy S6
too much crap with app
Updates late Canada is playing on July 8 and the app indicates the game x July 9. Also...the teams I only checked a few still do not have the rosters. Very poor
