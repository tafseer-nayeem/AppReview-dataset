Fun but It's kind of fun but its also hard because it's almost impossible to earn money. They really need to fix this game and make it a little easier to get money so we can actually buy stuff
It is ok I liked it but it should have a free ride mode and it shouldn't limit us on how much money I make and it should allow me to pick all passengers up
If you like watching videos that's the game for you. Another retarded game let me explain before you start the 1 time it wants you to download some other game , then you drive for 10 sec. And you have to watch a video , I am not joking . uninstalling f u
Good game but.. Keeps on deleting my progress every four levels so I just start over again 
Good but. .. It would help if you can actually pick up all the passengers and not keep freezing when the level has finished don't make sense
Not Even worth of this 1star also. I can not open this game... using in Samsung Galaxy Note 3.  When I try to play it, suddenly i come out.
Game repeats The game repeats over and over there is no way you can save enough to unlock the next area. This is not good enough for inapp purchases
Crashes on Nexus 7 The game looks like it'll be fun, but once I tap the style of driving tilt, steering wheel or arrows it just closes.  What a shame
Taxi driving It is a good game I want more cars it is very bore to drive
