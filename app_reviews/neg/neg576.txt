Episodes are not free Would've given 5 stars but what did u do after playing episode 1  Nothing i would say. Please do free episodes otherwise this game do not get much popularity as it requires.
Was a great game, just bought the next chapter but it won't let me play it and If I try to download again it continuously says I have already purchased this item.... It makes no sense.......
Cool game, but don't think I'll play it eny more due to the change from English to wot ever language it decided to be  Not happy.
some help please I bought the season pass on my Samsung s5 and I click episode 2 and it crashes as soon as I open.i wish they would make sure we can play the game b4 taking our money
Not a game It's not even a game. Why would u want to set and watch this No action no nothing. Way ti much cussing. That's ridiculous. I'm giving one star. I love the show and you just ruin this.
Game is fine, when it's not in foreign Bought the lot for 9 odd. Will be asking for my money back. The game is great but far too often the choices are in foreign so am guessing what I am putting which changes the game completely. Not fun at all when it's just a hit and hope game.
