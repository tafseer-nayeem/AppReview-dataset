Bonding NOT SUCCESSFUL When I successfully bond with another wolf it says bond successful but the wolf won't follow me or won't stop attacking me, and the sparkle around it vanishes  when I howl to get its attention. THEN IT ATTACKS ME AGAIN OR RANDOMLY DIES OR FALLS OFF A CLIFF Lol but CREEPY
It didn't  work on my Asus tablet.
Sucks Do not waste your money. It's a game for two year olds.
