Usless Doesn't log my workouts, recorded the time but not the route or distance. It used to work well, time to get an app that actually works
Not able to sync with My Fitness pal That's a bummer. I'm sure it's some sort of defect because we could do it before
Used to love it No longer accurate, the GPS jumps around, adds miles, subtracts miles, pauses the workout on its own. Have no idea why it no longer works properly. Disappointing 
Don't bother I haven't even used it yet and am already frustrated with it. Just trying to find a map app to see how far it is from point A to point B.  The other issue is it is not very accurate. You also have to turn the location on. This eats up battery life. Because my cellular signal is spotty where I live it doesn't give me an accurate distance when I turn location on. Pedometer and S Health are more accurare and easier to use.
Hmmm Be good if I could actually register and start using the app. My date of birth shows up wrongly having correctly selected from the menu. And my valid Gmail account isn't accepted. Will amend rating accordingly... Please fix.
Crappy Doesn't record accurate information... I have all GPS bars on the app.... I have 4 bars and 3G on my phone... I've cleared the cache reinstalled restarted my phone... I worked out nearly every day for the past month and was only able to log 4 accurate workouts and one of those wouldn't record I'm going to try something else
What happened This was great for tracking walks and motivating me to go further than I wanted. Buy suddenly it keeps pausing itself randomly at least twenty times on my walk into work today it definitely needs a fix and fast
