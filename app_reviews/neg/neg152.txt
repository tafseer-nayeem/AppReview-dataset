Won't Load Ever Won't load past the splash screen.  Just shows the splash screen then crashes.  Has been doing this for two months.
So inaccurate. I have spent too much time on this app looking for places and driving to perspective apartments only to find out that  99 of them were no longer renting andor had never placed an ad. Please update your information. Thanks
It keeps crashing Every time I click to go back it freezes on a white or black screen. Very annoying galaxy note 2
Freezes all the time Just downloaded. Tried three times to preform a search. Freezes after you look at one apartment. Uninstalled
Always messing up Never can I go online or on the app without it freezing or just not working like wtf.
Doesn't work Nothing is coming up on the map. I try to search an area and it wont. Uninstalling.
Phone app is dreadfully bad The website and the app for my iPad work perfectly fine. On my phone however, I can search the entire strip of NYC with all my filters off and one second there is thousands of places then I reload the app a second later aaaaand their gone.
Bugs  lies Crappy app and wrong information. App keeps shutting down and when I call locations, the prices are ALL wrong. I've found better accuracy on Craig's list. The app gives fake information just like Jeff Goldblum used a fake name.
Meh. Hard to use, everytime I hit a marker on the map, it won't register it, then tries to open, then can't.
