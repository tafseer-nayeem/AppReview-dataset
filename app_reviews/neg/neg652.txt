I paid for this app yet it does nothing but display annoying popups I guess some project manager at full fat told the developers hard sell the IAPs this year. I had this game last year and I enjoyed it very much. This year, not so much. I can't so much as select what I want to do and it throws up annoying camouflaged click bait all over the screen. NEVER forget I PAID for this game.
Boring Tedious, far too simple with few gameplay options.
Freezing It seemed cool then it would freeze then i tried it again and it was fine but now it freezes again after i rerated the game disappointed
Good game,  very dumb gift Why have a prize for playing each day,  when it won't remember you played anyway
fix please paid for game and a starter pack. had to reset my phone, now everything is gone. the 'restore purchases' option does nothing. will change the score when I get my stuff back
Played the previous one and loved it. But this one wont load to my phone
FIX IT Its a great qb game but every time I play for a minute its freezes then exit the game and I lose awards and stuff u need to updated it and fix it
Would be awesome...but.... IT CRASHES IN THE MIDDLE OF A PLAY EVERY MIN OR TWO....FIN WASTE OF A DOLLAR
