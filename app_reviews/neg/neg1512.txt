Great..... Until it stopped working A few years ago, it caused the Language and inputTexttospeech options screen to quit. The only way to fix it was to uninstall. I emailed the developer, but no response. Prior rating was 5 stars.... Voice very pleasant.  By far the most realistic sounding TTS that I have ever had. Even some of the usual tougher words to pronounce were spot on.
Not downloading 98 then stops. 2 devices, 3 WiFi spots...no difference.
Worked great until last update Stopped working with Google navigation after the last android software update. I've tried everything to set it back and nothing works.
Tone of the voice is good but... I wish they would improve the pronunciation and emphasis to produce a question instead of a statement. It would make the reading of a story more enjoyable.
Jessica It hasn't worked properly in sometime
Nice high quality voice. This voice and all of the other cereproc voices crash TalkBack on the nexus 5 running android 4.4
Not working for Kit Kat.
Settings crash on KitKat Since upgrading to Nexus 5,the app installs but settings crash when I try to change them.  Have another TTS app which works fine.  Got an initial response via email but that was all, disappointed I can't use it. Uninstalled till it is fixed.
Keeps crashing when used with pocket . Can I get a refund
