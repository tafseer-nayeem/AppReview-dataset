Ugly too Like the other Aviary paid filters, the filters in this pack are just fugly.
Effects I can't get the grunge and nos to load. I see alot of people have the same problem. What's the deal with that Did you rip us all off
Doesn't work for me Everything else works except for this plugin and grunge...strange
Installed but won't open How can I use this I can't find it and the only option it gives is refund
