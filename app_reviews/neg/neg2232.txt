Update loses coins Don't install the latest update whilst you have any coins as it starts you off at 0. I decided to update before playing at full regeneration and went in to find my balance at 0. P.s. Same thing happened with the pirate game update too
You now only get 2 dozer dollars instead of 4 from watching a commercial. Put the 4 back Instead of messing with that why don't you come up with a 3rd board.
Full of sh...... This game is full of crap. I did survey download games signed up for samples yet I still didn't get my coins. Uninstalling now. Waste of time. Will never play this again. Then it asked if you are missing coins i reported all of my missing coins and still nothing thanks for wasting my time. Ill be sure NOT to play again. Epic fail. 0 stars
Signed up for two apps and didn't receive coins. Support team has not replied. Is suppose to b a priority since customers keep them n business. Shame.
Big rip off This game isn't worth playing if you  can't collect the free coins with offers. I've been ripped off for 1572 coins now. I'm willing to bet i won't ever get them either. It's a good thing I'm not spending real money on this game. I would hate to get ripped off
Advertising Annoyance Pop up advertising comes way too often and they make it pop up right where you're droping coins so you accidentally click on it every time.
 IT IS THE STUPIDEST I CAN'T EVEN PLAY IT I JUST UNINSTALLED THIS BUT I HATE HATE HATE IT BECAUSE IT SAYS Unfortunately, Coin Dozer Has Stopped, THEN I'M LIKE  Is This A Joke AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW  I HATE IT
I've been playing this game for a long time I was level 146 tell I finally got the last red whistle all the good stuff goes to the side not once in middle without tricking it now nothing to do
