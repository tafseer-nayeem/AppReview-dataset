Wrost Bank in India We have 5 account of my family in Seelampur branch, Delhi. The experience is worst they don't have sense how to talk with customer. If you go to deposit or withdraw money around 10 am in morning you will come back around 4 pm in evening. Now my account is just like a show piece. I would like to rate it as a worst bank ever.
