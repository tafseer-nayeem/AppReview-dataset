 What is the difference between this one and the free one Because so far I'm not seeing one and I feel like I wasted my money
I liked it before I bought  it By some reason game stopped working at the  middle of journey . Excellent  I paid for it and not able end it
Love game but had to buy again for new tab The game is great but I had to buy it for a second time to put it on my new tablet...this is the only app I had to purchase a second time all the others didn't charge me because I already purchased it.  Also wants me to pay to add it to my phone again.  Won't do it.  Will not pay to add the next time.  Purchased once and it should all go to all devices I want to use it on.
