Fun game, bad app I loved the game.  But after the first time playing it, there was NO WAY to restart the game.  Close the app and reopen it, and you're back to the Game Over page.  Also, a whole lot of ads.  Going to uninstall it and try one of the many other 2048 games out there.
2048 rating This is a great game,  but the app does not allow me to easily start a new game once I get the GAME OVER notice. I have had to uninstall the he and then reload it.i have to uninstall it now   
New game creation issue After game was over first time I played it, I am unable to create a new game and play again.
Good game, bad app Keeps crashing and it won't start a new game when you have lost or won. The ad at the start is really annoying as well.
Like another user said, there's no apparent way to start a new game. I play one game, it shows me some full screen ad, and offers no way to start a new one. Really lame if you don't want your users playing ever again.
Can't start a new game What is the point if you can only play once Rubbish I like 2048 but will be installing a different version so I can play more
Ads I love the game, but there are an irritating number of ads that makes it hard to play it like a normal person and it doesn't seem to let you get rid of them.
ADS GALORE so many ads it almost makes it impossible to play the game. Want to swipe a move Nope, we are going to put an ad there so you can visit this random website you had absolutely no interest in. I will likely be uninstalling shortly because of this, shame to ruin an otherwise fun game.
Fun But the game only has one level is just a waste of time downloading to play the game just on one level and if u wanna play again u gotta start over.
Awesome game, crap app I wish this worked well but it totally freezes and locks up on a consistent basis on my Note 4 Edge.  Love the game, hate the app.
