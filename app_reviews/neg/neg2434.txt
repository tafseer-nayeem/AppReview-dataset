UM FIRST OFF ALL UR RUDE Okay I die and YOU decide know what let's play a happy advertisement saying I'm lucky I'm happy too U GUYS STOP THE ADS OR THIS STAYS
Its good I liked the game but the characters are ugly and I really hate when the character goes insane and guys please make the questions easy and I want you to let the character can answer and let him talk with the other characters not let them always talk to me sorry for bad english but I'm Egyptian
Wow, Just wow People can beat you up, people steal things from you, heck, even your family can murder you and get away with it. But if you take something back that somebody stole from you, you get in trouble for stealing and get detention. I thought this game would be fun but it isn't, just unfair. Please fix.
I don't like it You don't last long u get suspended almost every week and u don't eve n get to keep your character I lose it every time
You need to go to the bathroom but the teacher won't let you leave so when you have an accident everyone makes a big deal about it
Broke It's fun to play no WiFi needed but after class my character beats up someone and I get sent to the office for nothing and when it beats up someone all the controls go away
BEGGING FOR MONEY I can't do nothing with my dude until I buy a freaking pack for 5 SCEW THIS GAME
Ehh It was okay but kind of boring because every two seconds id either have a breakdown mentally and lose control or i would get beat up and robbed but when go to rob someone else i always get taken to the principal. IT'S JUST NOT FREAKING FAIR THEY ONLY TARGET YOU NO MATTER WHAT. So what ever you do don't be bad in this game or you'll freaking get these gay teachers tryin to take you in
What the heck... I waited for literally real time 4 weeks to be invited into a group and without me touching the screen it picks no to join a group. Would rate five if I didn't get an aneurism every time I play
I hate it Wen I want to do something it hides the buttons and I get in trouble for nothing and I diddnt get a break down air pee I will like it if u fix that and I always get in trouble for stuff I didn't do and wen  there is something I want It hides the buttons I especially hate wen u buy something  someone snatches it from u and when u snatched it back u bet in trouble
