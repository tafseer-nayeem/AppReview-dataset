Problematic wonder Problem lost all my personaliation after upgrade.............................. This was my previous comment I have been looking for a weather forecest app for a long time. Tried several apps even bought some of them.   Loaded this one minutes ago, at the first sight i could not really beleive what I saw. It looks really great, to be honest looks better than anything I saw before.  I highly recommend for everyone to try this app, I believe nobody will be disappointed.
Lots of information but UI is the worst I have ever seen on an app. Simply terrible and very very ugly. Please make a version with a modern look. I can use it but I won't show it to anyone   EDIT I have actually decided that I won't use it. It's interface is simply a pain  Waste of money for me.
Buggy Quite often fails to follow update schedule. I'll sometimes see it's been 6 or 8 hours since updating even though I'm on wifi all day and it's set to update every hour. Lots of options on widgets that have no effect on the widget. Lots of widget options that just plain don't work.
Would be great,  but too much of a pain Every Update frequent resets all prefs including widgets. Huge pain to reset every few weeks. UI leaves a lot to be desired as well.
