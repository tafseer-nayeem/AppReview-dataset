Can't launch app Samsung galaxy s5 active. Said app was moved too tools. No tools folder exist on my phone. App is also no where on my gear watch. So there is no ability too launch this app. I tried too use voice command to open on both devices but both tell me the app doesn't exist.
No longer work It was a good novelty app for what it does, but after a few days it just stops working. When i select it from the lg urbane, it just keeps on loading. Tried resetting the phone, watch and even uninstall and reinstalling, nothing works.
Now you tell us.... Downloaded this app thinking I would be able to control my phone's camera using my Gear S.....TricksAreForKids doesn't work from play store. Gotta download from Samsung apps. So what is the purpose of having this on my phone if I have no remote options. How does it work as an app on my phone After I paid for this download I would like to know how to use it
no bueno. app didn't show up in my app drawer after download. Couldn't find it anywhere except in my app manager. obviously app manager doesn't let you open in from there.
Doesn't show up in my phone I have an LG g. Downloaded it and it doesn't show up in the apps or on my screen. I can't open it.
Stopped working I have had it for about a month now and it doesn't want to load on my watch, tried reinstalling it and still didn't work
