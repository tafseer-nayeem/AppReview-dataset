Sell unwanted cars ASAP........ Change to be able to sell cars asap ..its been 1 year and still ill give this bad game 1 star ....DONT PLAY IT THEY CLEARLY DONT LISTEN TO THERE PAYING CUSTOMERS ....I HAVE SPENT A BIT ON THIS GAME IN REAL MONEY hopefully waiting for them to do it ...but nothing  . They could updated with I've asked and most likely alot of people want .   When done the things in the list ill give 5 stars and rate and spread on my facebook to say a great game .
Pay to play... Don't download unless you like being beat by people who spend a lot of money. You can get through the early races ok, then upgrade tickets get harder to get and you need more and more the higher you go. In the higher levels you have to win 43 races just to earn enough tickets for 1 upgrade,  it's ridiculous Or you can spend real money and buy tickets, such a scam.
What the hell I sell my car and i got nothin Comon.. With all my effort, i waste my time. 
Kit Upgrades Really I don't like that fact that I need kit Upgrades just to allow me to install parts it makes the game 4X's harder. I think it's stupid, I can barely get any nitrous kits
Bad experience game. Waste of time What the hell is this  We just here to change the gear of car  Hun. CAR racing games should be like famous games nfs most wanted etc . I hate this game its just waste my time.
Its big joke in a title of game 289 mb for this bullshit , disgusting man . Its a 2d game like u r playing a car race in a straight line , only you can see the one side of the car , no left , no right .why people download  this i don't know. Anyone wants to download please mind this review or else waste your 289 mb
