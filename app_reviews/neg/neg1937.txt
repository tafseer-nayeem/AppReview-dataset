 Nothing wrong with it. I just dont have enough space, but I cant get a refund. Please help me. Does anyone hear me I dont want to live with the fact that I lost 6 bucks to a game I cant play.
I hate rockstar games On GTA 5 I saved my freaking progress and it said I have 86 and I've been doing this for a long time and last night I saved it and in the morning I went go on it and it went down all the way to 74 I checked and I didn't have Michael and I checked the load game and it didn't even show the 86 . I will sue you for this so u better hurry up and get an update before I do sue u for this because I'm very very very mad,angry,and very boiled
No controls It used to be very good, but it has been a while since the controls have become very unresponsive, expecially driving, which is quite impossible, the controls do not respond almost at all. I'm using a Nexus 7 2013, is there anything I or We can do to fix this Thank you. Alessandro
Keeps crashing I can't even beat the first mission because it keeps crashing please update so I can play

Crap Worst game ever, the character is dumb, the ending is the worst, spent few hours straight and still going, but lose, I do not recommend this.
Buggy as hell can't even save the game since nothing shows up in the menu it's pretty much all black.. and the menus are buggy too... refund pls.
