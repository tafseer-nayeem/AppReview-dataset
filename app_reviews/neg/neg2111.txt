Lost all my levels I was up to lvl 165, after the update it started me at the beginning. I enjoyed the game, but not enough to start again
App harasses you. This app constantly notifies me all day long despite the fact that I keep turning the notifications off in my settings. Yet when I get another notification I go back and check my settings and they've been turned back on again. I do not wish to be beckoned back to the game at least once an hour all day every day. I think I'm getting an important text message and it sugar smash again. Please fix this and respect my wishes not to receive notifications.

Sugar smash I am getting no credits at all no coins for winning levels. If I was I would give it 5
