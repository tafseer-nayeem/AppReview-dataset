Its a cool game but most of the rooms are locked n unless u want to pay u really can't do much very disappointed
Not nice The reason y I gave it a 2 star bz  accept 3 rooms all rooms r locked
False advertising It states in your discription that the player can renovate a new house daily, with 7 rooms per house... however it does not state that the player only recieves all 7 rooms IF OR WHEN they purchase them, or the full version of the game, otherwise the player only has the option to renovate the same 3 rooms over and over again. I was enjoying this game until I realized on day 5, that I was still doing the same 3 rooms, with the same 3 problems, indefinately.
Sorry  Hi, I was wondering if you could maby please not charge us to unlock other rooms. The game is fun but it seems everyone has the same problem.  So please just let us have Al  the rooms. Then I wil turn this to a 5 star and give awesome compliments . Don't ignore us, we want what we want.Thank you.
Fair You can not do end thing u have to buy it I want a game that I can play all rounds but I still love ur games
Cool I love the game because it is cool
Boring Doing the same repairs over again untill you buy the next version
Boring There are only a few rooms unlocked so it is pretty much  useless 
Good for a child I guess... But, too long to gain access to new rooms. Uninstalling
Sucks It is so stupid you have fix the same 3 rooms unless you buy the full version it is so stupid it will be ok if the game was 99 cents by no it is 4.00 now that is true stupidly
Don't like Tab tale worst game's
Very unhappy customer rip off I really liked this game so I brought all the room and none of them unlocked I'm so not happy. You stole my money
I hate this game I hate this game I hate it I hate it
