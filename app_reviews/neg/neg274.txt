Sound will NOT work I have the paid version and the sound will NOT work. Vibration works but not the sound. I have deleted the alarms multiple times and set new alarms but the sound still will not work. Waste of .
Bad app It only worked for 2 days. Wasted my money 
LOCATION BASED ALARM   I am sorry to rate 1  to Draw your attention. But can you please add location based alarm in this highly customizable Smart Alarm.   Thanks and sorry as well. Will update to 5 stars after getting your response.
No support Music alarm plays at various levels I'm so tired of bad support where dev just ignores paid app users I've emailed dev a couple of times reporting that when selecting to wake from music, that various songs play at various levels no matter what I do It makes waking up very unpleasant when one song is soft and the next blaring loud Dev can you not be professional and support your paid users
