Objects are microscopic The graphics are stunning, the music isn't distraction. Sadly, the objects listed to be found are so tiny I can't see them. Add in the glare added to the room and you've got yourself a major disappointment. Make the list of items to be found large enough on the list so we know what we're looking for. They are smaller than two commas on top of one another.,,
Poorly conceived Anyone can design a game like this to be virtually impossible to win. In this case the images are far too intricate and miniscule in a setting that limits how much you can zoom in in a background that is impossible to discern one object from another. I huge disappointment.
Challenge game  adventure I love this game..more journey how to create ur mind
Didn't even get to play Soon as a page came up it vanished faster. Every screen was only a pic no clues what to find if I got to choose which mode to play they flashed through so fast lucky to see the word play. Deleted till never coming back here. Again ever
I actually love the graphics and the game itself. My problem is that there are twenty plus scenes that it picks randomly,  but after playing awhile,  it only switches between 3 scenes.  They aren't even the pretty ones either. I don't know if it is a glitch or what.
Try to load, goes to a blank screen, then goes back to start screen. Uninstalling
