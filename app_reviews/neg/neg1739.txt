Truly obnoxious ads They literally have full screen popup ads in this, along with the fact that the subway schedule and times don't work offline. This essentially becomes a glorified subway map underground.
Can't use it Pop up ads prevent this app from being usable.  Every time you close the pop up it pops back up ... Very frustrating
Why are there inapp purchases and advertising if the MTA raises the fare every year Shouldn't you people have more than enough money to cover all costs
Used to be great This app really is great, but since they updated, the app gets stuck on an ad and won't let me close it or use the map unless I restart the map without my data on. I will be deleting and using a different one.
Too many ads Too many ads.  The ads are way too intrusive and too many trap buttons. I dont mind ads and understand the need for them, but this has gone to far. Deleting this app and going to something else. These maps apps are dime a dozen. Good bye
What happened I loved this app but now I can only see the maprouteetc for about 1 min before the ad begins rising  covering my entire screen. Not very helpful when I am looking at a subway map that disappears into an Old Navy map.
Many unwanted ads The ads keeps coming back even you close it
Ads Full screen ads and ads at the bottom that occupy 14 of the map space.
Can't close the full screen ad
