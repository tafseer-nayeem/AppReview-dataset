Recent update wiped out weapon upgrades Unlocks on all weaponry were reset to the opening levels. Update was a big downgrade.
Nothing works Great game but so much is wrong with it. Every time i win a blueprint part the total number of parts obtained for the each gun remains zero. It also doesn't allow me to make any purchases to do with weapons because every time i press it nothing happens. Lastly the map is always the same which is a large downer because i find my self just doing the exact same thing over and over again to obtain points. Please fix this and i will give five stars.
Addicting Would Be 5 stars if it weren't for the push on in app purchases large investment play and refund to test if you like it
HTC 626s This is a nice game but it's lags and it's hard for me to aim. You should have different places not in the same place to do your mission.If you can fix it I'll rate it a 5.
Updated.... Now can't play Installed the latest update and now after loading the mission I was on it just force closes... Every time... Please advise.
Love your math guys How am I ranking at 209,000,yet only 100,000 downloaded Crashes at least... 7 out of 10 times, on 3 different phones lg g4,notebook 4 and galaxy s phone... Clearly by the reviews.... They don't give a rip They got your money already, why would they
Ridiculous update Lost my fully upgraded Chiper, need to start from lvl 1 again which is ridiculous. Because I've completed all the missions so my rewards only 10,000, wasting my time to make it fully upgraded again.
It's always the same effing level You only have to kill a different person to end the round. And you have to grind a lot if you want to get new weapons or buy them via IAPs. And it starts to lag after two rounds.
Nothing new exept radio man and replay option Markus krug is only remaining target Holy crap please put another target on my cross hair. Please add a new place and new target and new story and new gun.
