Last update was a fail. Updated the game, it used to open and now it won't. Please fix this or I want my money back. I didn't pay for a game just to get messed up.
Switched devices and now can't play Played this on my S5 and really enjoyed it. Bought it before it got its price cut and now I have a Nexus 6 after my S5 suffered water damage and the code I need to start the game, I don't have anymore. It's been months
DON'T BUY IT I bought this game about 2 weeks ago and it wants me to activate it with a activation code and if you don't you can't really play much of the game. But anyways I keep putting the activation code in and it says it's invalid. I emailed them about 2 weeks ago as well and I haven't got any response from them.
Freezing in purchased version, let down but good game concept The overall game concept and idea is very satisfying to play, on the Xperia Z2 Tablet, however it freezes constantly, causing the player to bet set backlose items etc. The game only seems to last 2,minutes before freezing and it can become very annoying. Update please and I will rate 5 star
Help Me I got rid of it after beating it, then noticed that the game company released a new update. That's why I reinstalled the game. But now I can't believe that the order reciept from the free game didn't give me an activation code... WTF HELP
Urgent Refund please What is wrong with this game. It keeps closing the app every time I play after few minutes from my start. Also it doesn't save any of my progress.  Every time i have to start the game again. Even when choose continue. Please take your game and give me my money
