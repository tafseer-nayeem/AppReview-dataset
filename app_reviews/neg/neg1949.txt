The new update sucks...... Ever since I updated it, it sucks I was so addicted to this game before I updated it.....not now it freezes on me all the time and it don't read my finger all the time and that causes me to die a lot.....
Clear all available RAM, first... The new update must use a lot of RAM, because it is jerky, stalls and I ultimately die early in the run. Not worth the new graphics and fade effects of the update.
problem after update after this recent update, game is not properly working in my Lava iris x5. Game speed is pretty slow, and it is also taking very much time in loading. please fix the problem.
I have no access to daily or weekly challenges anymore. It's not as fun with nothing to aim for.
The update is bling Ache khase game ke update ke baad  band baja di jab hole upload dikha kar hang ho jata hai.
I'm mad I love the game, and don't see anything wrong with it besides one thing.  There is MAJOR lag from when I swipe and when the character dies something, and its not my phone.  Please fix, because I love the game, but its not playable with it like this
New update crashes every game attempted. This big, exciting update has rendered the game unplayable for me.  The game crashes if I die or if I simply tap on the new Store button at the main menu.
Loved the game but sad now Till yesterday before the latest update everything was smooth in my MI pad. But after the latest update the game crashes immediately after clicking play. Rest navigation  in game is fine except the sizes of images have dramatically increased. Post update the game works smoothly in my Xiaomi mi3, but sadly crashes in Xiaomi mi pad. Please fix the bug as my 4 year old is big fan of Temple run2. He has even made me buy additional characters of bolt and Lee.
Lately not so good Used to love this, but lately it is always freezing or not registering my finger swipes. This is getting very annoying,  as it makes me die when it shouldn't
