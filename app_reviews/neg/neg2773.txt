Can't Load Game I have uninstalled and reinstalled this game 4 times. I have full Internet connection.  Have a Samsung tablet please fix bug.
It won't load. It stops at 20.
Make playing field larger. Too tiny.
Loading 20 Can't get past that. Got a reply saying it was fixed, I uninstalled  reinstalled,  I still have the exact same problem.
Fun on FB, won't load on Galaxy Tab Pro Have stopped started program multiple times, have restarted device multiple times and still won't load past 20.  Guess they just don't like Samsung devices as I see multiple complaints about this game on Samsung devices

Way to small images plse make them larger I'm uninstalling this game
This game would be better if it didn't keep going to Facebook after each level
Can't play on my Samsung galaxy pro tab 3 Freezes at 20 and won't load
Just started playing this on Facebook and kinda liked it until I started to play it on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 I was sorely disappointed with it, it doesn't load properly and when it finally does, there's a terrible lag and it's awfully slow It's not worth the download space in all honesty so time to delete
