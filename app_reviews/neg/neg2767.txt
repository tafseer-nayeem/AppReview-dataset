Not functional enough Tried to teach my son how to add two numbers. The fruites are too small its just too hard to count them. And also when he tries to touch the screen the level is switched to other level...
Take shaking the phone Shake the phone is actually very distracting when in the middle of the lesson... aside from that your app is very useful for nursery and kinder lessons. Just take out the shaking of the phone. Will buy addtnl features in the future.
Crap Why you people developed this crap  I couldn't even able to run it for a single time.  Everytime hangs and not responding would you like to close it. Uninstalled it within 9 minutes. Have to do some Yoga today  to lower the stress.
Can't do anything on it, they trick us to download it but once you've done that bam purchase app come up
