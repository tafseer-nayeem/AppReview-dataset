Used to work Since last Android Wear update the face essentially ignores the phone. No weather or phone battery info displays. Using Moto 360 1st gen. Did uninstall and reinstall, same issue
Was 6 stars till last update now drains battery way too fast
Won't load Crashes anytime I attempt to use it
Garbage waste of money.  Can't do anything with it. Going to delete. Don't waste your time buying this
Won't load to my 360
Great Looking Battery Hogger Love the look but it drains the battery very quickly. Within 4 hours went  from 100 to 20.  I cannot recommend this watch face until  problem is solved.
