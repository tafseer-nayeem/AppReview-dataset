I actually love the game I'm loving the game and have a ton of fun but I'm feeling really frustrated by an error that keeps happening. After a cinematicdialogue scene the game will freeze or the screen stays black right before I get control of my character. I don't lose any data as I get placed right where I last entered a room but some dialogues go on for quite a while and it's annoying to have to close the app, reopen and get through the dialogue again.
Bug problem When  ever I take small steps in the game there a battle every time I walk in it every second please fix it .most games not like that
