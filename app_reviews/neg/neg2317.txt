Doesn't work... force closes in my Asus ZenFone 2... pls fix this and I'll give this 5 stars
Yep It was necessary to put an ad overlay on top of the play button and those sweet menu sfx
It dose not give people the time to try to find the right place and it says fail even you miss two or three and that is the reason I do not like this game
