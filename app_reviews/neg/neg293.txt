Malware ads, removed features Ads go straight to your notifications this time. Many ads that pop up contain malware and are automatically clicked on. The game itself has removed animation slider and other essential settings in favor of bloatware. This is a huge step down from the original version released a long time ago. Do not download.
Ducking sound ads The game was fun, but it had ads that were super loud and annoying. Uninstalling it for that.
Fun game This game is fun no doubt. But when you get a pop up ever day saying play me play me. I gets freaking annoying. That's why I'm uninstalling it. You lost me.
