Frm 1 rechrge i Dint get my rfund from last mnth, dint get cash back, n frm one rchrg.. Mny was deducted but rechrge was unsuccessful
Money deducted for failed recharge Tried recharging for the first time on 20th october,money got deducted from bank,but recharge failed. Its been a month,still,money not refunded to bank.
CHEATER APP first your transaction get failed, then they dont return your money since last 15 days. their concerned team keeps saying, we are trying our best, the refund will be initiated. what the hell. are you trying to fool people by looting their money. if possible i would have rated it zero star.
Worst app Never every try any transaction I tried to pay bill using the app and so the amount was deducted from my bank account but I my bill was not paid
