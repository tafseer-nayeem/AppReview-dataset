I know it's not wheel of fortune, but it's not very fun in that when I play against the computer, its Their turn, only when it gets to them, the game ends. Not as fun as I thought it'd be
Keeps crashing I think I'd like this game if it didnt constantly crash on my Samsung Galaxy s5.  
Glitch I was playing someone  told them it's my turn but told me it's their turn. Game got automatically forfeited after 3 days.
I play this game alot but have not been able to play for 3 days not sure what is hoing on but not happy. A week later I uninstall then reinstall now all my games have been forfeited
Garbage As if Fuxking pictue ads weren't enuf, they have video ads that play for 30 secs and u cant bypass it. Please remove the video ads or end yourselves. Thank u
Not working This game has always worked and recently every time I open the app, it just closes out. I'd love to have it working again
Booooooo I loved this game and gave it 5 stars. It stopped working. I have contacted the developers. They have not helped me. I guess  I'm done...
Wish I could give less than one star Would give it a higher rating and buy it if they fix notifications. Tried the suggestion in FAQ but no good. They don't even reply when you raise issues.
Gave this game 5 stars at first, was one of my favorite games to play, but now it won't let me and my daughter play anymore says this user is not linked to Facebook when we both are And now it wont let us play against each other, we both have tried everything we could think of and nothing has worked And we have been playing against each other for months About ready to uninstall
Unable to play since update This happened the last time you updated with new categories. Game will not load and open for me . You fixed it very quickly after the last update,  I hope you can do that again I am using the Samsung 10.1. I love this game thanks very much
