fantastic experience marred by bugs at the start, this app looks awesome in the cardboard viewer but the constant drift and the nonresponsiveness of youtube videos just make it unusable.
What's with that drift Such a beautiful app with such a huge problem. That drift ruins everything, and the option they have to fix it doesn't work. It's unfortunate, but I'll have to go for a refund.
Drift Drift still isn't fixed regardless of calibrating. 10 seconds into a film and the screen is behind you and you're facing the back of the seat. Entirely pointless. Such a beautiful app ruined
Cant play I cant play yourube videos or 3d youtube videos and cant even search it plus the screen rotates towards the right side very quickly please fix ths asap Then ill give you 5 stars
Please refund This program look like it had such potentiality. I like that I might be able to watch YouTube on this. However the search function on here pulls up videos that I didn't ask for. I'm not sure why but it doesn't work very well at all. I would like my money back for this program. Thank you.
Not working It doesn't seem to work with an s5, although i do think it would be fabulous if it worked, can i get a refund please  Or is there anyway i can stream movies directly from my phone and play them on the cmoar cinema
Got nothing I'm now getting past the load screen but it's not letting me access files on my sd card.  It's showing as if it's the standard version
Great cinema, best one that I have used so far. But the drift after the last update is worse than begin. It was a makes a 2 star but it's so bad now that it's a 1 completely unusable. Will up to 5 stars once this is fixed.
