Terrible Customer Service The app makes creating artwork very simple and quick, but their customer service is slow and if the pro tools are lost to a system refresh or crash their advice is to, and I quote, just buy it again I've bought this twice before and refuse to again. Beware.
Import image not working This would be such an awesome app... If it wouldn't be for the bug that doesn't let me import any images. The pictures simply don't appear but the app seems to think it succeeded. A shame, really. Will change vote once the bug is fixed.
A nice simple app, but needs more features... It's a better, newer version, but missing features like those in the pc version, like perspective guides.   It has now been surpassed by  Infinite Painter, which not only has perspective guides, but a lot more excellent features.    So, autodesk needs to bring this app up to date..
KEEPS DELETING MY LAYERS I LEFT THE APP FOR 5 MINS TO FIND AN IMAGE, I COME BACK AND MY MAJOR LAYER HAS BEEN DELETED. AND DONT TELL ME ITS BECAUSE I DIDNT SAVE BECAUSE IT HAS DONE THIS WITH MY SAVE PICTURES TOO. WTF I AM SO MAD RIGHT NOW, THIS PICTURE WAS GOING TO BE MY NEW BUINESS LOGO AND NOW THE WHOLE STRUCTURE IS GONE AND I CANT GET IT BACK
PLEASE ADD STROKE SMOOTHING The app is ok BUT THE MISSING FEATURE is the STROKE STABILIZER OR STROKE SMOOTHING.. It takes a lot of time to finish the entire outline of my sketch and it is very irritating.. IbisPaint X has a feature like that and if you add it i think this would be a perfect sketch app.. IT IS DISAPPOINTING I PAID THE PRO VERSION THEN I CANT DRAW SMOOTHLY
WARNING PLEASE READ Do not trust this app All your layers will disappear forever I spent months on something and it is all gone. I cried real tears and I'm going to fail this art thing I'm doing. I'm really sad now  I just want my layers back
Yeah but what In general a decent app, if used for rough sketches, but I do not get, nor appreciate the fact that I had already purchased the pro version of the older app, only to have it thrown out the window and then expected to throw more money at this one. Pretty shady and leaves me with no confidence that anything I buy from this developer will remain supported. Gee first Corel and now Autodesk with no regard for it's paying customers.
It is nice to use for basics, although it has many faults. The undo buttons are at the top and feels unnatural to always move your hand to the top of the page. Your hand moves and clicks on different layers constantly many times without knowledge until it's too late. I could really do without the constant crashing also.
Keeps deleting things... Ugh. This is the 3rd time this has happened. I've saved my sketches and drawings an I was in the middle of a good one I spent time on and it's gone Can't find it anywhere I'm super upset
This game sucks  Whenever I pick another color the stupid thing won't use the color and I have to use the color gray
Problems I really like to use the app but when i work on a drawing the app freezes and i cant do anything then i have to stop the app and the drawing is gone. It would also be better if you could import psd files because i can sometimes only save my drawings to a psd file before it is deleted in sketchbook but after that i cant reopen it there
Back to 3 layer limit I don't understand why I have to have a layer limit again that's less than 20 or 10. Seriously guys can you fix it please.. It's not fair plus this is where I do my art work and I need more than 3 layers to do it... Why even go backwards and its part of the pro tools I even bought from you guys it's either you fix this issue or my money back
