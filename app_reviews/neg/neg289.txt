Fun but doesn't save your rewards. I liked it, I paid for upgrades. But then I wiped phone. You know how most good games have a restore purchases feature This doesn't. Don't play it. Ever. Play pew pew or something instead.

Poor game play These guys barely play tested this game. It's easy too easy, spend most of my time waiting for the zombies to move from behind the barriers. Most challenging part is when they throw an ad up in the middle of play without pausing it for you.
