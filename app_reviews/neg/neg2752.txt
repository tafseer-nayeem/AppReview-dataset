No way There is no way I am keeping this game. So boring . No other brushes And how is a baby to know what a color well is
Ads  popup and take over. If ads and ads for other games did not take over the screen all the time I would like it. Tried to use it to teach my granddaughter numbers 120, but kept being interrupted by ads for some combat game that hijacked the whole screen.
Now with Ads  Because my toddler is really interested in speeding up my phone or fighting dragons Now he opens up google play when painting  Uninstalled.
Omg I really doubt it took 20 hours to install You know who I'm talking about it don't even take 20 secs to install and this is the same phone model as you know who
This game has way to many ads for childern. Every time the erase is touched twice something pops up trying to sell something.
Sucks It sucks too many adds only two colours and when you want to erase then it erases everything.dont get it. It sucks.FIX I would give it 0 stars
Too many ads My 3 year old will be very disappointed that I have to delete this due to ads. The 2nd day we played it, she kept getting into ads. It was fun the 1st day only.
Telling I will tell you one thing never download a painting game beacause they wil always be crap
Too many ads The amount of ads that pop up while they're drawing in less than 5 minutes is stupid. Why not have one ad each time the app is opened instead of having them pop up while they're playing Bad design. Defeats the purpose.
1 star I loved is games because i don't no why
Waste of time downloading To me this game is retarded, because everything  erases really I think that's retarded
Hate it You cant use white or grey you cant even change the thickness of the brush
Ads pop up to trick baby to click Bad. Advertising try get baby to click
Not satisfied... I really not satisfied with diz app...ther's nothing in diz
Only a few shades of green I can only get the colour green
