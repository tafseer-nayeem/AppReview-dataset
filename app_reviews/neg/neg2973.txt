Great while it worked. Worked for thirty minutes then didn't work again.
Only the alphabet. The game on the Internet is free and has more activities. Very disappointed.
Wont open on Lg Vortex Love starfall, sad. Will try to reinstall.
Doesn't open. This would have 5 stars, but most of the time the app won't open.
Disappointed Loved the website so thought it would be fun to have this app. 3 yo kid played for 2 minutes and said it's boring. Would love to have a refund
Don't open Would love a refund.
This app does not work
Useless No options for settings, annoying good bye every time you go back to the main menu, substandard graphics. Found nothing to like Glad I got a refund.
