Crashes constantly Love this app on iOS but constantly crashes losing student work. No export to PDF feature either
Not happy Adding a pic to a book, but without any cropping or editing how is that possible. Adding Sound to a page Sud at least play as soon as you turn the page but fail here too. Tools like cam scanner can do much better job. Can please add these few features and get the remaining stars, otherwise please return what I paid.
Import I can't even import my books 
will not edit epubs created in Sigil I bought this app to update and edit files I created using Sigil for Windows but this program will not open any of them
26 1 stars nice
cant import epub I cant import the epub that i just exported. it seems pointless.
Disappointed I'm using a Samsung galaxy tablet, the function to rotate a picture doesn't work as it does on an ipad the function to turn the pages like a real page doesn't work either. The function to make the sound buttons invisible isn't on the app either. Please fix this so that it works on the Samsung tablet too. I will then rate the app 5 stars.
Absolute bs  bought it for school and paid money no refund when other apps are able to refund
