Good game  but sometimes annoying. Ok so I got up to level 75 or something like that but when I lost all my lifes I hit the quit button. So I thought that would get you to the title screen or home screen but it just sends me back to the FIRST LEVEL Really,Really,Really ANNOYING
It's a fun app. But I get stuck on question 95 and nothing I do will get me past it. I tried looking up the answer and still didn't get me past it, I'm uninstalling and reinstalling and it didn't help. Still stuck on 95... bad app.
Not working I've seen the videos looks fun but won't open and when it does it freezes 2 minutes into the game I want a refund please
This game is incredibly stupid. Most of it doesn't even make sense, and starting from the beginning is annoying. The artwork is sloppy and the sound effects ts are childish and stupid.
What On lvl 92 you have 10 seconds to get numbers from greatest to least and is should take 1520 seconds.
Awful What's the point of a quiz with completely random answers. It's impossible because it's stupid, not difficult. I love the questions in previous games with double meanings where you need to think hard for the answers, not when you have to try every option to see what works because the question and answers don't make sense. Would ask for money back but I won't waste my time. Uninstalled.
