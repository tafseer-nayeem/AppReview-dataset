Every few plays it freezes and having to reset game and reload. Nothing I've tried corrects it..ever game appx ever ,47 plays freeze, reset from main app screen.
Solitaire I had this same app for a couple years  it was great. After my phone crashed I had to get the app again and it is so different. I used to have times below 2 minutes and frequent wins. Now I haven't won in probably over 100 games and the last time I did win it was closer to 4 minutes. Having played frequently I'm now seeing the pattern of how the cards fall. I'm uninstalling and will find a different game to pass time.
It was a great game but it seems since a recent update it began to freeze up, I finally got fed up and uninstalled it and reinstalled it since then every other hand I play has a pop up ad This sucks and I will be promptly deleting it and looking for an alternative.
