LG G3 screen wake After using a root required app. Wake lock detector shows this app, in the screen usage, using a lot of my battery and to top it off the screen got hotter bc of it. I'm sad I paid for it and got no response from my email. Tried restore reinstall with no luck same issue.
What happened to root keeper for ota Bought pro for this but don't see it in the settings anymore. Am I missing something Will edit to five star if it is still there
surivival mode gone one of the mains reasons i bought SU Pro was for the survival mode which appears to be missing in this current version  i am using the one plus one and am running CM12 official builds any help would be greatly appreciated  i will give 5 star when this has been fixed but for now i can only give two
Can't Solve my problem Every time I update this apps I'll facing a problem No SU Binary Installed. After I purchase pro version the problem still exist. Please help me.  Samsung Galaxy Note 3
Great tool but with a catch Was using it on the free verion, everything was ok and fine. Since last update some root features became accessible only with the pro version, that is unnecessary expensive.
Not working right On my phone if I  have this setup to have apps ask for su permission I get a popup screen that doesn't work and the request times out.  Not good.
