Idiocy. Such a waste. I'd like a refund for this ridiculousness. I would've given more stars if you simply NAMED THE ELEMENTS. Such a massive flaw This is just a mindless tool to keep toddlers antibored.
All black As others have commented all black screen after logo. Unable to play at all. Real shame as all the other apps my daughter loves.
stupid Absolutely mindless game. Not even an element is named.... nothings explained..... How is anyone suppose to learn from this let alone my kids  Ive had to pull out my periodic table because im not downloading one and help them figure out what was what and even then these experiments don't make sense or teach your kids anything. Scam scam scam in the form of a cutesy GAME and that's all it is your kids won't learn crap.
