Awesome game but... Since the update all I get is a black screen. Sort it out Ratrod I hope my data isn't lost because I had almost everything in the game. Fix and I'll rate 5 again because I love this game.
Sucked Really leggy and not a lot of content
Meizu mx5 after install shows only black screen
Points system Its a top game but the points system is stupid. Rather then realistically trying to line up jumps to get more points your better of constantly doing 360's before the jump to get ur combo multiplier up. It had alot of potential
No extras at all Bought this after doing all of the lite version, and not only do I have to start from scratch, but there are no more levels than in the free one. Explain please
