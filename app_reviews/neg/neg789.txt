Mira is not functioning on my s3 please refund. I use portrait professional on my pc but will not work at all on my phone
NOT WORKING I can not browse a picture and edit in this app.
waste of money
Error error error. Don't waste your money on this pile of crap
Juliet 2.99 gone to waste. Doesn't make me look any better, just really weird. Absolute rubbish, get on much better with Beauty Plus and it's free
Doesn't Upload my pictures I don't really want to give this app 1 star but I have no other choice considering I spent 3.99 on it and it will not upload any pictures from my phone Gallery, it keeps saying upload unsuccessfull it's pretty annoying when it happens with every picture.
Didn't work Wouldn't let me press continue after adjusting edit for chinnose, didnt even work with the example. Waste of money.
