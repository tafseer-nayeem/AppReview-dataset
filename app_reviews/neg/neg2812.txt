Paid app nags to install other apps Every time you start it
Galaxy tab Paid for full version ,  but says cannot   be installed in default location 
I purchased the full version and it only had couple of more puzzles then the free version. You have to click the next button several times before it advances to the next puzzle. It constantly shuts down. Wasn't worth the money that I paid for. The only reason I don't delete it is because my granddaughter is 2 and she likes to play it. Waste of time and money
Limited vocabulary  Why are there only 6 words in the food category Children have to expand their vocabulary knowledge. I saw the other categories but it is still limited.  Thank you
Unistalled My phone restarted and became unusable after installing the new update. Had to hard reset and a lot of pain. My phone is motox 1st gen.
Won't open I purchased the full version and now it won't even open
Tedious Really awful since it has been updated, it could be excellent, but it's unresponsive and slow. You tap 56 times, nothing happens, you try to move to the next one and nothing happens. My daughter loved this app, but now I avoid letting her use it as it's just disappointing and frustrating.
Ugh. The only reason I still have this is because my 2 year old son loves it. Its laggy and slow and I find it ridiculous that there are no women in the professionalcareer section. I'm not usually politically correct but if my 2 year old notices its all men like Daddy, and no one like Mommy, then I have an issue with it
Jobs are all male Why is that Can't women be doctors or scientists
