Caution Research prior to installing. You cannot easily get it off your device. If you want to snap a photo in a hurry forget it. Instead you'll get an irritating message about unlocking the camera first and then it allows you 5 generous minutes. If you like losing the ability to get a rare photo in an instant this  app was made for you.
Why do you keep reminding us to uninstall The uninstall link on the switch panel is in the way. I know of no other utility which wants us to be constantly uninstalling by accident. That is just weird.
