Removes document pics...disappointed Because it was so useful on my IPhone and I was happy with it, I immediately downloaded it when I switched to Android.  What a disappointment.  For the third straight time it DELETED all of the pics of receipts I've taken.  And cost me those for work.   Plus their response to troubleshooting is atrocious.   I do not recommend on Android.
Terrible quality images Not working on my phone. I have an HTC 1 with a great camera. I take a picture and the app converts it into the shittiest quality PDF image ever. I'd like a refund. Maybe there's a bug or something. My coworker has the same app and it works well for her.
