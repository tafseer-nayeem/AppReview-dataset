Great game but... I got it and every thing but it won't let me play plz fix plz plz fix I really want to play this game
WiFi problem I love the game and it's fun, but my high quality WiFi doesn't let me get the app I WANT MY REFUND ALREADY downloads and I'll give 5stars
Very cool I can't even download it. I have fantastic connection and it gives me an error after every attempt. 5 dollars spent on frustration. Sorry, 4.99 but still.
Can't play it Every time I try to play it takes me back to here and I payed money for it and it doesn't even let me play. I'll rate 5 if I can even play the  game otherwise I want a refund if you fix 5 stars but until then I will not download any of u real engines games
Unablw to download Ive bought this game before and it worked and its a great game but then I deleted it and im trying to get it back but it says it cant find its default location. PLZ FIX
I hate this game This stupid game won't download on my phone I keep saying that I need storage space but I have a lot of storage space in my phone
No refund The game itself is good but I've had it for 3 days and it won't let me refund it gt
