Just too many ads Listen to me this app sucks its just a Gun game whenl you press it and it makes a big boom pow noise okay so get it just listen don't get it listen to me listen listen listen listen listen listen listen to me because if you don't you just spend   seconds of your life for nothing  trust me don't get it
Meh Has an excellent variation of guns but all their sounds are just ripped off of Counter Strike and CoD. App crashes often and just gets boring once you go through all selections of guns.
Obtrusive popups I know ads pay for this app, but they're so obtrusive that it interrupts the app usage.
I don't want to use this when it keeps opening up adverts in the Play Store without me clicking on them.
Hi Wait what we're  rating the app not talking to some randoms oh cap what the fudge cake
