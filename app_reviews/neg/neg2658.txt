... Why doesn't mPoints work 
Finished Category I have categories finished that are not popping open the next category they should.  please fix
Category unlocks Love the game but I'm giving one star until you fix unlocks. I didn't play 75 games or whatever of the one category that should unlock internet memes, just to still need to buy it with coins. Please fix and I'll update the review. That and since spelling errors aside, great game.
Can't log in anymore I have had a lot of trouble with this app over time. Now it's worse than ever. I can't login VIA Facebook account. uninstalling.
Had to do factory reset Lost EVERYTHING Achievements  coins... Gone Literally starting over...  support sucks
App wouldn't load. Unreinstalled it And now it won't log in. Help
Categories gone I no longer have the recent New categories. The 80's, the 90's, Irish, Valentine's categories, etc.. they are all gone. Why'd you remove them Horrible
Categories missing Where are my 5 star categories gone Movies and TV shows I've completed and they've gone. It says to unlock Reality TV I have to complete TV but it's not unlocking WTF
Love the game, BUT, can no longer purchase new categories with coins since updating to paid version, tried emailing got no help same with the help center. Please address this
Fun, but... I love the game. When I do have a glitch, there is no way to tell the  developers about it from within the game. ANNOYING. edit I just sent an email to the address listed here. It is an unattended mailbox. Just dropped from 3 to 2 stars. I would raise my rating of they had an easy way to give meaningful feedback.
What's the point of the paid version I paid for the app to not have ads, but now I'm being forced to invite my FB friends when the app launches. I will invite my friends when I want to. Don't ask me everytime I open the app.
