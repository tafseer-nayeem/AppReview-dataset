Spam ads with low quality gameplay This game is essentially a disguised advert. Either make a game worth playing and then leverage ads OR make a crappy game with nonintrusive ads. This one is the worst of both the world. Even my 5 year old can tell the difference between this one and some other games.
escape the prison. the worse game I have ever played in my life.
How to change name The game is awesome but one drawback is there isn't a option to change name coz it gives me random chota bheem character names and i want my own name so plz suggest a way to change it
