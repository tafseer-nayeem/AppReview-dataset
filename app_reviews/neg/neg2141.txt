GET RID OF THE SOUND. OLD VERSION WAS BETTER
Can't turn sound off. Please fix
Can't turn off sound
Buggy Cards disappear, float around the screen and sometimes aces won't move up and the auto stack feature will allow you to have one ace buried, twos on two suits and go to a seven on another and you have to manually turn auto play on and off in a single game. Poorly coded.
This is a terrible version of free celll . Very hard to win and I just figured out why, I had a card missing from the deck in my last hand Uninstalling now.
Not a bad game. Problem I have is cards get lost or stuck and you can't win the game. The game won't allow you to fix the mess up by placing the correct cards in the boxes.
Not my kind of solitaire, I ony downloaded for coins in a game which I never got and now I can't uninstall it.  Lousy game
Get a different app. The game automatically stacks cards as they become available. This means that if you need a card that it decided to stack there's no way of getting it back making many of the levels unbeatable that would otherwise be easy. Terrible feature that really ruins an otherwise decent app.
I hate the stats crap and the timer. I just want to calmly waste some time.
Free cell has stopped working for me.  I get a message that it has stopped right in the middle of a game.  Have uninstalled and reinstalled several times.  This was my favorite version of all the others so with great regret I have to say goodbye.
Unable to move cards 2 minutes into the game it stops allowing you to grab stacks of cards so you can't play the game correctly
Game was good in begining but for some reason auto move would turn off by itself.
