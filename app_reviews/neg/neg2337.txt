No change of chords Same chords are playing, no changes in lenovo a 6000, lolipop os.
this app crashes too much i try to play a chord and it crashes right when i strum the guitar simulator
Very good game my best
Slow Slow and awfull sound
Stupid ads
Too many ads Every time you change something,  another ad pops up. Not happy with the amount or the fact you can't skip them. Removed.
Pop Ups Galore I was loving this until I figured out this app was sending  popup messages on my phone. Only option is to delete and never download
Nasty app Good, but u can't play a song it just takes u to some stupid adds and that's it U can only do freeplay and thats it not any songs u want to play horrible
Update sucks The new update made this app the worst Gets crashed as soon as I play a note. Will give it 5 stars again when the problem is resolved
