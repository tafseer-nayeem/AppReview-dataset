This game should be 5 stars. It's awesome. But TOO MANY POP UPS. never in my life.... So many pop ups it crashes. It's ridiculous
The game was great but now im level 37 and my storage room wont work and i cant redeem my things i collect to make stuff because everytime i do the game freezes and now i do a reset on a game with my gems and it takes my gems away but doesnt reset the game Seriously going to delete if problems arent resolved
Boring... I am a great admirer of Tamalaki but playing this game makes it feel l8ke I am playing Criminal.Case Energy Bar  5 Stars etc... The one that gets to me is that I NEVER get to play any MiniGames. No fireworks, Honey, Building Materials etc... all I get are the normal searches Shadowed Images, Negative, Memory and Scrambled Words. Is there more to it
Annoying I know this is a free app but omg there are way too many pop ups. It was very annoying. Plus I don't think this is the entire game. If I'm not mistaken this is just a free trial. Very disappointed.
Don't play this game To get to the end is only a journey of frustration.  Playing the same scenes over and over and over and over and over again. To gain next to nothing in experience. I am so sick of this game I don't even care to finish it and I am only 1 room away from the last scene. I never quit at anything but I am throwing in the towel on this one.
