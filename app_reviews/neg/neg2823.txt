Plz fix the problem It was going well for last few months. After the Xmas effects was active, from this morning, I m facing technical issues while fishing. Please fix the problem ASAP. Wheather I m collecting diamonds  from my fishing books, or trying to catching fish, the app is shutting down showing the message of Network problem. Does not matter if I Reconnect or Exit, I loose my game progress.
