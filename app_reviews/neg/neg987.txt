Frustrated I think the concept behind this app is great however when I put in my beer profile and then load a new recipe it never adjusts, even after adjusting the actually recipe itself it does not change the grain bill. Having 30lbs of grain for 5 gallons is inaccurate. This isn't the first time this has happened which is frustrating. Also every time the app updates it deletes my profile and previous saved recipes. Any and all help with these problems would be greatly appreciated.
Lost all my recipes It was great, but all my recipes were deleted when it updated and it will only save for about 1 hr after entering a recipe. Please fix
FIX IT LG G3 Perfect application for creating  storing my recipes. Until the app decided to delete EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY RECIPES AND REVERT BACK TO DEFAULT EVERYTHING Thank you for deleting my Gold Medal Imperial Stout recipe. Mother Fr
Not working anymore Losing data on my Nexus 7. Won't retain my recipes or profiles. Worked great before but not  anymore.
Frankly this is useless. Every time I go back into the app my profiles,  recipes   units are all reverted to factory settings.  No details on how to fix this online. Going to uninstall and try another app.
Lost all my recipes during last upgrade
