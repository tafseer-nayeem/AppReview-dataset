Cheats like hell This game is rigged.  The opponents are ranked. The higher the rank the greater the cheating. I would like for the creators to fix the cheating and allow randomized card play. The game would be great if the cheating was fixed. I have uninstalled this game. It is not worth memory space.
Too often give your opponent wins. Not realistic enough.
It deals the cards only based on the skill level you choose to play against. The cards are never dealt randomly and you never lose fairly. The hands are dealt so predictably you can almost know exactly when your opponent is going to lay down a winning hand. Whoever designed this app collected the paycheck without putting in the work.
The game is fantastic.   however, the free and the purchased version both totally freeze up when I come back to the app later.
Shuffle You would do well to learn the word shuffle.
