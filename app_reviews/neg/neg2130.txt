Why can't you take all your chips no matter which place in the app you want to go play. I went to the Texas holdem table and only had access to a lousy 100 chips. WTF IS THE POINT, SERIOUSLY 
What a joke for a game dont waste ur time. It would be nice if i got the chips from the 3 apps i downloaded and opened..instead i got zero so thanks for wasting my time and space on my phone
Used to be good. Now manipulated results This app used to be good. Lately, I've noticed this poker app has become like so many other poker apps where the outcomes of hands are manipulated.  Too often one made hand is beaten by an even bigger made hand.  No where close to true odds here.  Useless as an app to practice your poker skills.
Predetermined Ive played 12,000 hands. The cards need to be randomized more, they most definitely are not random..if u played the real game in real life u would know this app favors people and the cards are not random Im pretty sure whoever bets the most money or plays the dumbest wins the most pots..OK THATS IT IM DONE I AM DEFINITELY POSITIVE THIS GAME CHEATS YOU I AM NOW UNINSTALLING
Why I can not play with my Google account,y u must Bullying people with registration and so on..
