Stickers are a scam The game is fun and the graphics are very nice. Only 2 stars because the game never gives the last sticker for an image. We've had all images minus one sticker for several months. Also wish all characters were unlockable without real money  even if they were ridiculously high.  Especially want Huck so I can play as a boy.
Game freezes My daughter loves this game, but after a while of playing I have to delete and reinstall the game because it freezes. Please fix this bug
I downloaded this app for my daughter and she loves it, unfortunately it randomly stopped allowing her to run again after she hits something.  I have to go in, completely close out the app, and restart it every time she crashes.  The daily goals disappeared at the same time.  Please fix
