Not working Worked for about two minutes after I downloaded it. Now when I try to open it it freezes on the menu page. I was so excited to show this to my son and now he can't play it.
Why aren't the buttons locked out This app manages to entertain my toddler for exactly two seconds before she hits the capacitive buttons on the screen and exits the app. Why are the buttons not locked out by a longpress requirement
