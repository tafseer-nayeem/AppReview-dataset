The games in the app are definitely interesting for young readers that are starting Phonics. I am incredibly disappointed that the app stops working every time we try to watch a video.   For this reason I am unhappy with my purchase and would love to know if there's a way to refund me for this app that doesn't completely work. I have contacted the developer and no response, and tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Does not fix the problem.
Won't work Immediately app pops up that it has stopped.
Super why phonics Wouldn't complete download them wouldn't refund
not working No sound
Poor quality sound Voice keep on breaking
Never downloaded Waited 5 separate times for the game add ons to download. Green bar would show download was complete, but it never finished, then  the download started over. Dissapointing.
