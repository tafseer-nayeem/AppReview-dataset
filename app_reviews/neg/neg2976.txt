Doesn't work The app doesn't say any words like it says it should. The flash cards do not say the words like it should. A complete waste. I can't figure out why it won't work
It downloads  but then it tells me error cant download . ive tried 4 times and still  nothing . how can i get my money back
I purchased this for my kid who is in 1st grade. It stopped going to next levels once he finishes the 1st one. I hate it.
Misspelled In the Bingo game it says the Aliens are finaly home.  Shouldn't it be FINALLY  A spelling game with spelling errors You even have a screen shot of it on the Play Store.
Bad experience So sad, first time I download was OK. But I switch my sons  tablet, for the same brand exact model, know I try to download and nothing I try like 15 times and nothing. So I don't think is the device.. Cause is the same as before
Upset I purchased this application yesterday and  every time I open it I hear the intro to the app but the screen stays black Was really looking forward to my son gaining from your app from all the great reviews Please fix IT HAS BEEN A FEW DAYS SINCE I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK
SO BADLY DISAPPOINTED The app worked one time and is now completely black its a shame because my daughter loves the app when it worked plz fix this soon
