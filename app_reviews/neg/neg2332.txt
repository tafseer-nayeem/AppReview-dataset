It lags and the piano screen isn't long enough for me to actually play a song I want to
Wrong app 4 me I guess Not smart enough 2 figure out how 2 get songs so I could play them. I was just expecting something different
I love it  I'm amazed
BADLY DONE I don't know wat to say but I hate it and my 3 sisters brandi,khloe,kaci hates it so bad they told me to delete it
This is not the playing piano ever this suks It sounds like the first piano game that ever came out
Add our favorites Can the creators of the piano please create a search option so I can search my favorite songs if you would I would be really mad
