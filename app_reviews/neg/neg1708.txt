Expected more options Great, userfriendly layout, but I expected more options.  Bugle is realistic, but voice recordings are extremely poor quality.  For a purchased app, they should be realistic, closer to studio  or at least cell phone  quality.  Doesn't convey that authoritative voice
All the way up Alarm volume is all the way up and if it's not up to your ear you can't hear it. Nooo thanks. I'll take a refund.  Sorry Gunny better luck next time.
Stock alarm Why not just make the sound available for the stock alarm. Voice activated alarms not available with this. Bummer.
Doesnt work On the site it said it works on iphone... It does NOT
Please fix bugs Unable to set minutes by typing them in. Sound is way to quiet needs to be adjustable.
Crashes the first time I open it. Every time I open the app it crashes then I have to open again.  The voice levels are low even at max volume.
Worst.
Needs lots of improvement The sound is very low, and you can't even preview the alarm. You have to wait until the alarm goes off before you know what it sounds like.
Disappointed Regardless how many time i change the sounds for the alarm it is stuck on the alarm clock. Very disappointed.
I am unable to switch alarms. Once I chose Reveille it got stuck in a loop. Even after uninstalling and reinstalling no matter which alarm I chose it would play Reveille.
