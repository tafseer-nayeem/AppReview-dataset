Inaccurate temperatures Temperature more than 10 degrees off and no ability to change weather provider
What happened Loved this watch face but out of the blue it stopped working. I have to reset watch faces for it to come back on. After a while I'll go to check the time and the screen is blank. Weird.
Love the design, but... Great looking watch face, but constantly crashes my moto 360 if I tap the face. Sadly will be refunding it. Potential repurchase in the future.
Constantly force closing on my Sony SW3 with Galaxy S6.  Unusable.
Can't set up I can not put this watch face back on my watch. I got a new phone and after downloading the app the watch face does not show up in Android wear app. It worked fine until the apps icon disappeared from the apps drawer.
