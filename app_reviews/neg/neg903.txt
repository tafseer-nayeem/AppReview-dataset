Not as good as the previous version Female voice talks too fast and where are the stats  I very much preferred the previous version. Tried listening to meditation 1 in the can't sleep category and the recording is so quiet I can't hear it unless I use headphones. Frustrating
Extremely fast paced There is absolutely no time to focus on the mediation. The speaker keeps talking with very few pauses.
May I request To have a profile that tracks my stats Plz. Calm and Headspace will get my attention
Not up to the mark After using other meditation app I will say it is totally disappointed as a rule of  meditation we should spend some time in silence not that we should keep our mind busy by listening to the advice continuously.
That Female Voice though One of the female voices is way to fast, and as a personal taste I prefer a male voice. If there was an option to choose between male and female voices that would be amazing.
