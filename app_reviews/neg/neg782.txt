Support for Research Papers Please Sometimes when I open a document or just go on the app, it doesn't load anything. Every. Time. It's insanely annoying, and makes me wonder if the Google team reallly tries. Another thing, why can't you add superscript numbers and autogenerate footnotes What's the point of this then You're better off using the memo application built into your phone
Forced The fact that you are required to install this app to do something that could easily be done in a browser gives it 3 stars.
Needs multi window support One star until that happens. Some Google apps support it and others don't. Where is the consistency
Unable to open password protected documents Please fix this issue.
No open source support I will not use this until open source document formats are supported, Google is going backwards with this app
When i type sth it vibrates and cursor goes here and there. Please do sth. Its note my phones fault because it happens in google docs only.
Sucks I'm trying to write an informitive eassy but can't insert a header. And I can't use the website because of Google
Can't Remove Came on LG G4, don't use, can't remove. Waste of space.
Not syncing My docs are not syncing with any changes I have made via a laptop This is frustrating
