Needs  Adobe Air Would have been nice to know BEFORE Ii wasted my time downloading it Deleted
Lame Total bor and the jet pac thing i used a quick memo and to the creator SCREW U  P.S I HOPE YOU GET HIT BY A CAR
NOT FUN It would be fun if there were more ways to win but no. Every other weapon kills youI get why it's free now
Omg I got out on the first try like I thought it would be impossible but it wasn't I got out too easy sheesh waste of time downloading just think of the worst thing and read the description
Didn't get to try it. I would have tried it but enforcing me to download Adobe air to use is ridiculous. I use and have tried most games available, some with amazing graphics ... ie, evolutionbattle of utopia. Memory space is like gold dust. It is unnecessary.
