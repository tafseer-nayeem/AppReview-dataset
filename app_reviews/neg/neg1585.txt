Haters Haters
Moco ads Not sure if it's a glitch but I have mocospace and I'm being flooded with ads on it not impressed
Grrrr Not letting me log in with old account nor create a new one. This is extremely annoying I keep getting the message user name must be between 620 characters long when both the old and the new one have 18 characters. I'm not sure what's going on but I paid for this app.
Moccospace has allowed its network staff to set up secret staff to set up secret forum to invite all best chatters away from forums killing them for casual users making this dead. Adertisers and users are waste of time here Any reports to them are ignored and you only read of rapists and killers in papers in the paper's that on here now.
Would be rated higher if I could upload pics in IM like you can in the free version with the ridiculous ads
parents beware its has been called most dangerous social app for kids by colorado police dept
Wtf First month was add free now I got adds in the chats, 11115 ok ads are gone now but can't send pictures in the Im's without an update but mine is current
Bad It does  not notify  me when I have messages.
It's ok In some games Moco offers I don't get the coin exchange
