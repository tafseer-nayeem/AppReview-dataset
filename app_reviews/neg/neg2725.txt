Uhh What the dumb is this Holocrons are rare and hard to find because many search for them...but some how as Grievous I was able to run down a path and collect them.  Needless to say this does not follow Star Wars at all.  Holocrons contain holograms of dead masters Jedi or Sith that depict their life and fighting style, Bane learned from them to become elite.
Controls are...not so good. The game looks great but the controls make it almost impossible to control a ship or character. They aren't responsive at all. Overly sensitive sometimes and unresponsive other times. Not consistent.
Lazy Cheap repetive animations, no gyroscope controls, slow, and overall boring and lazily made. Seriously, no gyroscope for the falling sections too Why can't I just tilt my phone I can actually control it then too Do not bother with this, there are far more entertaining games on the market... But the space battles are fun at least.
Good but lacking Good, but why cant we have the full lego star wars complete saga console game that apple devices have 
Rubbish The controls are crap, any auto advance game should be ignored as they are crap, and so is this. No where near the true lego starwars on other platforms. Just rubbish really.
