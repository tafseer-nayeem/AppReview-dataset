Location I live in a small town end the location is not the correct one. What will happen when I'll go in a big one I'm gonna stay 5 hours to find a hotel.
Not as good as Google Maps You know it's a dodgy app when you see the exact same wordforword 5Star reviews from, I'm guessing, the developers and their friends and family Try scrolling past these obviously sycophantic reviews and get down to what the actual users of the app REALLY think of it Not such a 5 starry night now is it

Chinese Language Maps with street names in Chinese doesn't help me at all.
