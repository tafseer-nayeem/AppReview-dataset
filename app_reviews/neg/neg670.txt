Hard  Sorry I only gave your game one star which is poor. Its just it was hard for me You always have words that COULD be there and then it corrects you when you could have been right even when you have filled all the rows in    Umm and yeah that's all I have got to say.  Sorry for putting down a picture of thumbs down  I should feel ashamed of myself 
Good game but... The app takes complete control of my audio. I can't control my music volume when I turned the sound down in the game.
Don't buy. Paid app and no exit. The back button works in the free version .
