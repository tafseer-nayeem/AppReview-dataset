Didn't get to really try it because no G2 Bushnell Reticle You want 30 for an app, I'll pay it. But get more reticles. Requesting refund.
Wtf Dowloaded on galaxy s5 just get a white screen. I can add a rifle but that's it just a white screen.
Not for me I found other APS that do a better job for free.
Just started playing around with the numbers, so far this app is way off from what I have verified so far. Maybe I don't have the numbers in correctly, but compared to my at home ballistic program it is much more detailed. I'll continue to play around with it until I figure it out, or chalk it up as loss and dump it. Perhaps I'll report back at a later date to update my review.
