Lose it Used this before and it worked well. I really loved it. When I got my new phone the app didn't follow so I downloaded it and decided to upgrade to the pro version and now it won't work. Ugh I'm afraid to Uninstall and reinstall for fear that the upgrade won't work. How do I fix this
Approximate and cumbersome It is very cumbersome to log all the details of meals and exercises even if using custom meals and recipies.

Since the variance is likely in the range of 2040, a simpler system to log calories would be advisable.
