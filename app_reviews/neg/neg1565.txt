Why haven't this been taken down yet Complete knock off of iFunny. This is got to be the cheesiest, whitegirliest reject knock off on the Play Store.
Same pics all the time So lame. The pics are the same all the time. I've waited a week to see if the change n they are still the same.
Too many ads Too many ads, can't navigate without being hit with ads.
Its ok hard to navigate.
Waaaaay to many ads Every time I'm trim to see a post, it ALWAYS takes me to the freaking internet trying to sell stuff or something. I hate it. Remove the ads, then I'll install it again. But for now, I'm uninstalling it. 
What happened to iFunny Bring back ifunny  This has no search option, limited saves unless you upgrade and its cumbersome to use.  A poor relation to iFunny.  Uninstalling
IF YOU HAVE A GALAXY.... I only downloaded this so i could put up this reveiw, for those of you who want it back, IF YOU HAVE AN ANDROID DEVICE i found Ifunny on the galaxy store. Search for it on the home page and it'll come up
