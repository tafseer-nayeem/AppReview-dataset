You get ur 5 stars when.... U need to fix hide drops from bears and bears still dropping empty, Add a aiming reticulecrosshair for weapons, decrease mining time, increase resource payouts, not every lake or shore needs a croc, add more things to docraft Instead of farming trees or rocks all day jus to get 1 coal and 1 iron wtff ur fixes did not work this update
need more there is very little to do in this game almost as little as nothing and bears dont drop skin and deer dont drop the horns needs more to do and have the animal to drop the right stuff..the game is fun at start but the fun stops way to quick ill rate it 2 maybe 3 now if they would update it and add to it like more to add to your housefishingboats it just needs more alot more in it....
I'm stuck Literally My character is stuck and I don't want to start a whole new game respawn option would be great I'm letting him die out but it's taking a long time
Do not buy The game developer is nowhere to be found, and the game has some serious glitches. It won't take you long to reach a point where the game is no longer worth playing. Save your money until the game is updated at some point AFTER July of 2015. Such a disappointment. Could have been a great game.
STOP DO NOT BUY and now Kills with no defense want MONEY BACK  CRAP KILLS OUT OF NOWHERE
One star until I test EVERYTHING Due to your free games lack of play time, I am 1 star rating this until I can test all functions.
