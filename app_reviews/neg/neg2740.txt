Super why Should be 99 cents or free. The game is not as user friendly as it should be. Select a letter or word and nothing happens. Try again, oh, now it works. A selection should at least highlight, then maybe grab it. What were they thinking  Probably written by a 20 year old with no teacher input.
Very disappointed Either my phone is too underpowered Galaxy Note 2 or this app is simply not written well. The responsiveness for tracing the letters is very sporadic. Additionally, the stickers screen is very static. I'll look forward to future updates, but my 3 year old dismissed the app after 5 mins
Doesn't workno refund Didn't work in my samsung galaxy vibrant no reply not refund. Downloaded and paid it again in my ipad. My kids liked it, but shouldn't have to pay it twice
Disappointed but hopeful My main concern is there seems to be an issue when attempting to trace the letters. Please fix or advise
