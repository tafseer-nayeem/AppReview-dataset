New interface is awful, hard to read. No response from support. So they removed a perfect, readable, pleasant interface they had in version 2.x and introduced a new simpler interface, with thin fonts, poor contrast, hard to read on the Galaxy S4 and devices with high resolution displays. The game I enjoyed the most has become a torture. Why fix what's not broken From 5 to 1 star due to a single change. No response from support.
Disappointing Bad bad bad bad... I am not able to see my opponents friends list with the new update anymore, can't see in wich other languages my opponents has been played either. Old version is way better for much. FIX THAT
No option for 1 player gaming What if I don't want to play against others
Games not bad, but I've made 4 purchases of coins and they have NOT  been added, plus I've sent 2 emails to the developers and have never received a response... BOO on Communication with the developerscreator's Terrible because they NEVER get back  with you when you send them an email with program or purchase problems and Google doesn't even have a number for them
Keeps taking MONEY out of my account for coins, and I'm not receiving them Multiple complaints NO REFUND
