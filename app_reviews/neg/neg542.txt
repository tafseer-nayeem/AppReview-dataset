Bad service experience How do it remove my contact details from your app n site. When it ask for the service it's not provided and after 5 days the service provider constantly keeps calling and forcibly wants to come and complete the task  Do you feel anyone will wait for 5 days for your confirmation and visit
Totally hated The delivery boy so called champs don't behave with customers properly.... You didn't even mentioned the offer details first.... Champs are troubling us even after the delivery.. Sorry but totally hated.... 
Would have given zero if possible Very tardy service. Appointments rescheduled numerous times. They quote one amount at the start of the job and try to take more money after. Customer service hardly cares about your complaints
