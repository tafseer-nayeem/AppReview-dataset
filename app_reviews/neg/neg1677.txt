DON'T USE WHILE MOBILE DATA IS ON Just started a speed test thinking I had wifi switched on as I have a new router at home. I had mobile data on and this app then used half my monthly data... 295mb on  a test
Privacy concern This app hasn't been installed on my BlackBerry Priv for 6 hours. In that time it accessed my location 244 times, I used the app twice. Uninstalling and spreading the word till companies that spy on us fix their apps.
