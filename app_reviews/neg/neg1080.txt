Features minus Stability I love the features in this app, especially the orbit and panorama features. But the app crashes on me too often. Several times each flight the app will suddenly quit. I can not use it due to the stability problems. Also failed to connect to validate my license when I was on a client flight in a remote location. Not reliable. Can't use for work.
App Crashes App crashed twice even before I took off. And I was not asked to pay. The program just downloaded and installed.
