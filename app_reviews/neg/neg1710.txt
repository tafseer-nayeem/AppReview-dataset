Good ideasHorrible execution The application delivers easy to use interface and some really nifty features, but 2 star rating due to the almost impossible to handle lag and no ability to export your work.          Using a Toshiba Excite Write tablet, even with a simple pencil tool and about 1.4 GB of free RAM on the device, there were considerable lag spikes even on a smaller canvas. Overall good ideas and features, but still needs a lot of work
