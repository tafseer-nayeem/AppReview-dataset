Doesn't Work Does not work on my Samsung tab and neither on my mobile S6.
New update crashes right away
Nice idea, gui is goofy I've given up on this app and wrote my own in Tasker. Maybe I'll try it out again sometime in the future to see if any of the glaring bugs and missing function is fixed.
No Seems to use data from domestic weather stations most not set up correctly. Not a forcasting app relies on data that is unreliable.
Rife with bugs, New beta nonexistent It appears the developer has given up on this app. No updates in a while, still rife with bugs. A shame. According to posts on Google, the new beta is dead. Dev doesn't reply to inquiries. Don't waste your money on this app.
Updating Okay but it needs to automatically update like other stations do not worth buying
Useless Will not hold location weather station.  Works ok if you only want one location cannot set weather for multiple locations. I WANT A REFUND
Sencors don't work right. The sensor temperature doesn't work for the Celsius scale but works for the Fahrenheit scale. How come
Poor showing Will not display imperial units no matter the settings. I'll take a refund until the new version is released. Maybe soon.
Most weather station dot have good data poor app im a spotter
