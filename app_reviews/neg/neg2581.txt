Don't be fooled by the screenshots. The screenshots make this game look much more expansive and complex than it truly is. I was quickly disappointed in the ui and lack of things to do. Despite the cool asthetics, the game is slow, clunky and kind of boring.
Too hard, takes too long and no Note pen support Takes way too long to do a level. No point saying put it on fast forward. The fact that I can't use my Note 4 stylus also makes no sense to me. Finally, the repairing of units is really unbalanced. They take a tiny bit of damage and the cost is the same as if they were half health. How does that work Could be a great game...
Took everything I broke my other phone and had to replace and had over 40k points and lost all of it
Could be much better Not very much going on, games take too long and gets boring quickly.  Needs more strategy, troop types etc. Tutorial is rubbish.
