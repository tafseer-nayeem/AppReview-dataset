Keeps crashing Bought this game as I liked the franchise but what a disappointment it turned out to be. A couple of days of play then every time I proceed to a match it crashes deleted an reinstalled still no joy reset phone cleared memory still won't play.
Can't play the game on new device I had to change phones due to the fact my old phone died. Now I can install FM but it gets stuck in the game start process. If there's no solution to this I will have to ask for a refund
Latest update  awful You have utterly ruined this game. The latest update has made this unplayable for somebody used to the previous version. Games are now painful, PAINFULLY slow and have loading screens where previously none existed. The management screens during matches don't display properly. I've wasted countless happy hours on this game before the update taking minnows up to the Champions League and would like to waste many more but you've forced me to give up on it. Real pity.
Too slow gameplay It's still too slow in matches. The speed should match the one from previous version. Football manager 2014 is by far the best. Should reconsider when creating 2016.
Very dissapointed I wasn't sure if I should buy the 2015 FHN and annoyed that I have,it's very slow even on the fastest commentary setting , and that's the main frustration, takes a long time to get to a match and half time you are informed of all the other scores before you kick off again......ahhh frustrating
Original engine After updated the match engine very fast still not fixed yet.. Still slow...
