Nice App but. . . . Interesting part is locked. . . I will go for another App.

Pricing In order to find out around how much it costs I had to email the maker of it. This is unprofessional for them not to list the price until you purchase it. I still feel lied to.
Only two games open wish more were open
Probably would be good but it wants you to buy them with no obvious pricing so I deleted them both
Educated Nice my son play every day and like this
