Nothing loads  Not even menus load in under minute, and when they finally do, only half of the information is there. The search engine also never loaded any search results before I gave up waiting.    It's slow and clumsy which is a real shame
Too damn slow Com on Nasa. You guys can do much better. A superb interface just ruined by one thing... slow loading. It takes ages to load an article or a news or whatever. What's with that. It's not rocket science to compress data for faster loading onto our end user apps right. Please make loading faster. Waiting for a speed optimized update. Thankyou
Not working right now Waiting to see eclipse feed online and the app doesn't work. Fix it and ill rerate
Nice app but... Always crash on my Asus MemoPad tablet. It used to be nice app while I used it on my phone but now it's not working properly
Constant crashing on start I have sent a crash log.  Hopefully this will be resolved soon so I can watch this channel.
Launch notification I just saw a launch go off by looking up in the air and got no notification on my phone.  What good is this App.
