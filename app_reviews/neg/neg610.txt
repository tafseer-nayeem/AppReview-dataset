Screen goes blank if dress screen opened
Hatted it Why when I am go to put the dresses the screen will become blank...irritating
I hate  a lot  lot lot beacase  it stuck  my  new after uninstalled then I got  it it occupies so  much  space  it my tab
Its bad I freaking hate it
It's ok As we finish all the dolls the game becomes boring please fix ittt
Would not let me finish it kept going back to the home screen It was okay but it could be better if you had more choices for hair clothes and headbands and bracelets and all the choices and it would be a lot better if it wouldn't go back so much so I can finish my person so yeah oh by the way this is my Shauna Miller this is her daughter lol
Irritating My daughter  loves it but the items she unlocks by viewing the short videos don't  stay unlocked
