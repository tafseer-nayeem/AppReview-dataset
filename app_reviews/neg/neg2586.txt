Won't let me play When I click play game it shows me Help Wanted and it loads and puts me in my home screen... REALLY Plus I am not scared of 5 nights at Freddy's l
I like the game but every time I checked different cameras my phone just shut down. So I give it a 2 star.
No idea I'm a pretty smart game player but I just installed this game because of the excellent reviews and absolutely cannot figure out how to play it. Am I supposed to move from room to room and if so how do u do that I just don't understand what the concept is and what the outcome is supposed to be.  There are no directions...that I can find anyways....can someone help soon or I'm uninstalling probably sooner than not.
Bug  slow on samsung The game runs at perfect speed first but then it starts lagging when im turning my face from one light to the other. Plus the app exits on its own after a good 3050 seconds please fix
Crashes I get through to 4 am tops, but then the game just crashes and brings me to my home screen I  haven't ever yet gotten a jump scare and yet I've played it about 20 times. Stop the crashing and maybe add another night instead of just night 1. Do all of that and I'll rate it 5 star
Unsatisfied..  The game's crashing  It looks great, but when I click continue and when the phone guy starts talking it'll crash.  Hope you can fix it immediately ..
