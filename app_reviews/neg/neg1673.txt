Deserves zero stars Dont waste your time with this app, press back and download something else. There were way to many ads in my notifications. Uninstalled.

Doesn't scan. No accounting for lighting or natural blurglare Held over QR codes trying  to scan with no success at an outdoor screen for 20 minutes before giving up.
Lacking on capabilities. It supports your camera autofocus but it won't scan small barcodes. No way to adjust for it.
Doesn't work on Samsung Galaxy S5 This app used to work great on my Galaxy Nexus. But on my new Galaxy S5, it never recognizes any QR code I put in front of the camera, no matter what lighting or positioning I use. It doesn't give any diagnostics that could help me figure out the problem either. On this phone, this app is useless.
Horrible Has only been able to scan one thing the whole time I have had it. It was a box of tissues. It managed to scan, but it came up as womens razors. What All other scans simply failed. Do not buy
Works Occasionally I'm rating this right before I uninstall it. It didn't work well on my Android. I've had much higher success with another app.
Terrible Not only is the interface not user friendly, but the app doesn't work well. Tried scanning a QR code on a package and it completely failed. Same code was recognized in two seconds by QR Droid. Uninstalling now.
I have tried scaning things and it never works, the first time it took me almost 30 min to get it to read a qr code. Im gonna have to look for another scaner
Hard to use Uses my phones internal camera so I have to turn the phone around to scan stuff blind and there is no settings to change this
Fake app This is fake app because any time if you scan product it say shop advisor, I scan chocolate box it show me shoes
