Close down problems Change this for now as I'm having a lot of problems when closing the app since the Thanksgiving update. It often freezes on a blank screen and I have to do all sorts of trickery to get it un frozen. Using HTC M8.                       I especially like the little quotes when you get a new bear. Some of my bears are very strange and some are downright dirty...
Update I used to love this app until the update broke through. I was around 2 chapters away from beating the game, and I was about done with beating the boss i already unlocked it and was only 4000 points off from 387,000 The next day I came on, I saw that this app had an update. I thought, perhaps this would be brilliant However, it said the boss was locked. I had to complete Sunscreen. This was the extremely difficult rare event. Now, the game isn't as fun as it once was for me.
Can't pass level 3 Its a fun game but I paid 5 dollars to get unlimited honey and I can't even pass level 3
Update sucks, may uninstall. Since update, has locked a boss that I was previously able to play to force me to do a stupidly hard challenge. Has taken ALL the fun out of it as I can't progress now. Ugh. Might uninstall now as there's no point.  edited due to reply  that's not true at all, I was really close to beating the boss with just two bears, and am nowhere near beating the challenge with three It's much, much harder 
Irredeemable cashgrab Only got to play half a dozen games before the cool down mechanic, honey, grinded my usage to a halt. Ran out of ads to watch quickly, and not enough unhindered play time to warrant dropping 7 to have the privilege of actually playing more than 2 games a day.
