Bugs It's a fun game, however sometimes I'll solve one and it won't take it as the right answer and when I skip it and then go look at what the answer was it was exactly what I had. Also at one point one my tiles was an A and when I hit it it showed up as an H. If the bugs were fixed it would be tons better
Confusing and frustrating Cannot get by Mr T as it only allows room for one letter and the clues are wrong for the picture in question. Orson Welles can only succeed if you put in Trail instead of Trialsomeone there cannot spell
Not all that Some pictures are good some are useless have no clue. Would be better if they used the movie cover
Good for about 5 minute I played it for a while and I thought it was good, then I got stumped and needed a hit. I downloaded the game they said to for free hints, but when I went back onto the game it said I need to download another game. I got it and the game said I need a new game. They won't give you free hints with that. DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS GAME
Good game Spelling mistakes  I've got to the decendants and there is no 'a' to let me to the next level
Ads Way too many ads. Every other puzzle is interrupted by an ad.
Ok Constant ads and some of the pics don't even hint towards a movie.
Buggy The Trial is The Trail and once you get to Selma it crashes among other problems. This game is in serious need of bug fixes. Has potential but needs cleaning up.
Won't let me get passed Selma for some reason. Please fix
Not bad, poorly made. I get that there are limitations but some of these aren't even the right films and others are spelled wrong and knocking 'the' off the title makes it wrong. Stop that.
Too Many Ads Too Many Ads, Hate It
To easy
I hate it Poop
To many adds I understand it is a free app but i cant type if adds pop up every level...will be deleting and finding another app with less adds
