Couldnt even get startex..Don't want emails I am not able to set up account unless I check I want offers and emails.  I do not want spam and emails from any where as they just fill up my inbox  Why not say in description can only be used if we can send you lots of emails
internet reliant I do not like how this app is internet reliant. The app itself is very good but here In India where internet is awful the app crashes a lot and i find myself spending as much time trying to get on the software as i do actually using it. You need to make an offline version
Meh thing ever JP Great for weeaboos. It isn't useful for learning practical things for some languages cough Japanese.cough. WHEN WILL I PICK UP AS SEA URCHIN AND SAY TO SOME ASSHAT THIS HERE IS A SEA URCHIN. Exactly. I wouldn't. Weebs will love it because of their over obsession with aneemoos.                     EDIT I used it... I did not have a fun time. It costs too much.
It didn't start me where I was I logged in with my username and password, but it kept starting me in unit 1 I'm in unit 3, I've tried uninstalling it and reinstalling, and kept getting the same problem
Like the ideas but app is clunky and slow Really attracted to the immersion aspects of Rosetta but the app is appalling. 3 pages to click through before you get to loading course...   More often than not I give up and use one of the other language apps that loads you immediately to where you left off
Awful tech support I bought a year subscription. Now when im trying to return it and i can't get in touch with  the support team. They are just ignoring the emails
No Marshmallow support Nexus 7 with Marshmallow won't finish loading a course. Email support with zero answer. Crap support after paying them so much
