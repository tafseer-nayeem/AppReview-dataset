Why not more passes Why dont the creator of this game gives us more passes than 3 passes every 4 hours This way it will increase people to play this game.
NAUGHTY I got the most speed internet and suddenly it said that I have to reconnect a lot of times. What is this You spoiled my mood, you know
Outfit not showing up I liked the game, it's fun in all. But if I pay REAL  for something I expect it to be there, not disappear. I bought gems, then bought a dress with said gems. The dress is no longer showing up on Demi's Exclusives. Very disappointed.
Such a good game but can hardly play it, it keeps unexpectedly closing itself, and sometimes I'm only on it for 10 or 20 seconds before it closes. What do i do Still happening and its getting on my nerves
More stars and tickets I dislike the fact you 4 HOURS for 2 tickets and have to pay for everything if you want to get different outfits, also this app doesn't have the mean girls for me the only stories it is letting me play our Demi, Campus crush, and Real Hollywood....
Not Acceptable We should wait like 30 minutes for 3 free passes not 4 hours that's just ridiculous
Um.... I liked it but don't understand why you can't write stories on ur phone. Such a hasl anyways it's a good game also waiting for tickets takes really long  fix it and I'll give a better rating
All you guys want is  Seriously, whats the point of playing a game if I have to spend money to enjoy it So close to uninstalling.. you don't give opportunities to get gems but everything helpful you need an excessive amount of gems to help you play and make the game enjoyable. These apps are so Money hungry it's ridiculous. Fun suckers. You are not getting my money.
Realy... I have to keep reconnecting and my internet is speedy like crazy and I am gettimg a little upset about this. Trying to ply the season 2 of demi lovato
