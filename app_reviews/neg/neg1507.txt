.... Can't put a simple frame of effect on without downloading loads of stuff first. Can't even save the photo you crop .... rubbish app
Wrong There is no way to install frames or effects, the only option it gives is to Uninstall what was supposed to be already installed. Gonna have to delete the app all together.
UGHHHHHHHHHHH I downloaded it but the app never showed up on the phone I even checked and it said it was installed The next day it wasn't installed any more and I had to reinstall it
Not happening I always loved these frames and they always worked now, try as I might, I can't get them to work  what happened
It's not all that I thought it was Nice but the pics are so small it needs to be the size of the photo I say it sucks sorry fix it and maybe I'll change my mind.
TERRIBLE So I download it then it says I have to download each frame by itself Uuh not for me thanks.........
Not fun, should definitely get updated The frames don't have any fun details or fun colors and not a lot of frames either. This should really get updated.
Good for nothing app Worthless app Doesn't even open It just sits there staring back at me The only option available is to UNINSTALL
I use to love this set of frames I just updated this app and needed to reinstall the original frames, first out it won't install. Secondly, there are fewer frames Why the change
This is very wicked idea to develop the app, firstly it installed for free and while using its shows charge for using frames  sticker also, without paying its same as your inbuilt editor, then their is no need to instal it for free
if possible i would give it 0 stars After i downloaded it it said on my phone succesfully downloaded i went to open it and it keeps saying uninstall instead of open.  Very angry
