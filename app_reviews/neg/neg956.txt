App not working I've spent a lot of money on this and today it stopped working. Please fix or refund and I'll give 5 stars back.
Paying for nothing We've paid lifetime information twice to enable 160 characters, but the app still doesn't cooperate. I received a message today that said, We're giving you 10 free days...  Ummm, no. I've paid for it twice, and it Still doesn't work. FB section could be better, as well. We feel swindled Pretty crappy ...
Buggy. This app sticks.  It's good at times then really crap other times.  No response on comments from developer.  Disappointed given the cost.
Works when it wants to Paid for full features and it works horribly. One minute it works the next it doesn't. Not worth your money just use free version and hope it works majority of the time. Location is ridiculously off will update if it starts to become more accurate.
Yall need to work the bugs out. All in all its a decent app
App does not work I have contacted these guy twice regarding this app not working. Don't care to answer I have paid for a lifetime app. You guys are not supplying that My next step is contacting the right agency to file complaints in order for refund. Why I never rate an app to early. Seems these guys will take ur money for a broken app DO NOT DOWNLOAD
It doesn't update as often as it use to. So for hours they could be anywhere
Not accurate The gps it's so off it almost got us in a fight. Lucky for me I looked at my location, it's way of too. We can be sitting side by side and shows me in town and him kinda close to home.
