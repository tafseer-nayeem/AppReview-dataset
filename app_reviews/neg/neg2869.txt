WHAT THE HELL I made a really amazing world. Left forma minute. Came back EVERYTHING.GONE. please make it so we can save the game or all the hard work is pointless
Fun game but doesn't save progress I worked so hard to create an awesome world but I had to leave the game and 5 MINUTES LATER EVERYTHING WAS GONE. but still a fun game
Won't save world If I am off of the world I just created for 1 flipping minute it will make me start a WHOLE NEW WORLD
Add more animals and biomes. The game gets boring after a while. Add more biomes and animals. Also, make the map bigger.
