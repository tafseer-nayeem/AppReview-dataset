Stuart, I want to love you. You just aren't ready. I will keep an eye out for updates, because I love Scotch accents.  I had him read me an article.  His voice crackles. It isn't terrible, but it's distracting. And generally, it isn't as natural sounding as the default voice options for TTS on my phone. I will keep an eye out for updates.
