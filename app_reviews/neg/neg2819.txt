Forfeiting for no reason I am uninstalling this game. On two different occasions,  it has forfeited my turn before I even began a round. And it wasn't because I ran out of time. Another time it forfeited a round after I completed it, stating that I hadn't answered the questions. I have no idea why it does this. Can you fix this I will reinstall it once that is fixed.
Good but has some issues I enjoy the game, but the chat gets full and there is no function to clear it  and once it is full no new messages will populate.  If the data is lost you cannot retrieve the player code as the button does nothing
False answers and no way to report it James Bonds middle name is M i don't think so silly game 
Game is fun, but if the people your playing don't respond you have to forfeit the game to get rid of them and then you loose points. going to uninstall
Quick BrainGame I have revised my Five Star rating to Two Stars. I have played several games over the last few weeks and had zero problems. Today the game told me I needed to be sure I had a connection. I checked and I DID  have a connection but the game still told me I lost all credit. Why can't I replay the round instead of assuming a digital glitch is cheating
