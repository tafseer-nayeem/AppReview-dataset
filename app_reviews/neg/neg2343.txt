Real Bass It's a little slow in response and its only for right handed players. The sounds are a little too synth sounding for me.
They've broken it. Don't know what they have done but they have some how managed to make all the notes the same, impossible to play any sort of tune, they've also broken the guitar version. So I hope they get it all sorted they've ruined a couple of great apps.
It's good if you don't need to Palm mute or like to play drone notes. It is okay if you are looking to play drone notes but you can't Palm mute for just short notes
Help I'm not sure if it's the my phone.. But the 5 strings keep play one note each.. No matter which fret I play... Using xperia z 3
No record and extract feature Please add extract to mp3 feature. Then only will give 5 stars
Horrible..... Garbage Casio keyboard sounds, and nothing like playing a real bass... Don't waste your time. .
Doesn't work very well if you want to actually learn bass, which is what I thought it was for
