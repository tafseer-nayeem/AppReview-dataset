No menu button It's a good idea, but I don't have a menu button, so I can't make any adjustments to show my personal goals.
Could be useful no menu button This app looks very iseful, but there is no menu button Can't set anything without a menu button
No menu button I had this app on my iphone and liked it but them moved to a samsung galaxy alpha basically it doesn't do whatever it says in description. No menu button, cannot set my budget or change favourites. Waste of money
Note 4 There's no menu button anywhere. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Doesn't work. Google doesn't give any solutions either.

My weekly budget Worst application ever my phone the galaxy s5 apparently doesn't support it I asked for help with support and all they said was to Google how to get the menu button so I just paid .99 cents for it and all I get is an application with no setting Waste of time
My weekly budget Does not work on Samsung Galaxy S4
A fix for Samsung users Previously used this app on iPhone and thought it was great. Cannot find a way to use it on my samsung s5. Has anyone figured out how to use it, or isnthis issue being addressed I would like to continue using it rather than request a refund if possible.
