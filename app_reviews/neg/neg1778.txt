Give me choice on ambient 1 star until the devs make ambient mode optional. Let me keep the cool looking watch face on as long as I want. Others do it. Facer and Watchmaker to name 2. I can live with shorter battery life.
The app looks great. Sadly the weather for Finland is not accurate can be off 10 celcius at times. Tried with both weather providers and forced locations. Can't recommend.
