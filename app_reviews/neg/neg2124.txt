Tedious A lot of hidden object screens which didn't fit on my phone and very simple puzzles. In fact some of the puzzles were simply to collect the right objects. The symbols on the map are tiny, but after 34 of the game I realised they tell you where to go next, which would have sped things up a little.
Mediocre game with bugs I play a lot of games like this and think thay this one is just ok. The magnifying glass is incredibly annoying and I wish that there was an option to turn it off. I would have given this a better rating except that the game CONSTANTLY gets glitchy and then freezes when I try the safe puzzle. I did submit an error report, so if they fix this problem, I will modify my review.
i am not 5yrs old i do not need a magnifying glass to show me where to look,at every scene,whats the point defeats the object of the game. ive basically paid for a walkthru. boring too
Game malfunctioned wat a crock Trying to stop it from downliading after i got my refund back tslk about still going. Tried to stop it but cant. Crap And us ing up data in process
Not even worth the discount prices. I have spent more time going in and out of the game due to it continually freezing...I finally give up and learned my lesson the hard way.
