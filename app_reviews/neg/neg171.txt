Tee Tee Baby I try this app it doesn't work for me so I guess it ain't for me because it's very difficult because sometimes it shuts me out so it doesn't work I feel like that they need to fix it or upgrade it or whatever the case may be
Not accurate Timing off compared to my other calenders.  And I couldn't find any useful information.
Zero features Several websites online give you this exact info not enough features for a full app download. No chartingtracking etc
Hope it works My husband and I have been trying to conceive for 5 years, so hopefully this app works. Just started using it yesterday Fingers crossed that it works Good luck ladies
I have A 33 day cycle. I hope this works for me First time trying I'll let you ladies know. Baby Dust over here 
Not helpful For cycle length, it only goes up to 35 days, and as my shortest cycles are 42 days, this does not help, at all
No results The calendar is very badly off  I got off my period on the 11th and the calendar said I will be fertile between the 11th and the 16th that's impossible...
