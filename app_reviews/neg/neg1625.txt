Functionality removed Ability to purchase OS Explorer maps  which to me is a kind of functionality  has gone from the basic version. I only bought the Pro licence to support the developer for providing this ability.
Good when it works Bought this for a trip to Ghana to avoid roaming charges and now the licence has expired. Aside from this, and a few crashes, a reasonable app.
