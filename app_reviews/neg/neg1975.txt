Too quick Come on.. Only nine rooms. And it doesn't even show you that you've broken out at the end. To easy. Much more levels please or we riot
Level 6 problem I used the pliers on the razor and they disappeared off my inventory so I wasn't able to use them on the bed spring wtf
It sucks I played the free version and thought it was pretty good. So I bought this one thinking there will be alot of rooms. It's the same thing as the free. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. JUST PLAY THE FREE VERSION. SAME THING. I'D LIKE MY MONEY BACK. LOL
Glitches Glitch on level 6 will not let you use pliers twice.
Good, but disappointing The only decent escape game, but only has 9 rooms 
Short game Only 9 level very bad
Good but short Great game but only 9 levels. Very quick to beat
9 rooms Dont download easy game and at the end nothing happens.
It's really bad
Lockdown It would not work I would like a refund thank you
Waste of time and money I need refund please
This games sucks I tapped things and it wouldnt pick it up there are no good directions in the game like other games like this habe. This game is just crap
It's a good but.... It's too easy you just click on the screen without any intelligent and you can win how is that. Another problem there only 9 levels, really
One of the most simple level design I ever played not worth a penny, and doubtful even if it was free
Don't understand the concept What am I suppose to do so many bugs needs to be fixed
Wont give me a refund The game won't even install and when I clicked refund it said  Can't give refund right now. Try uninstalling it. I want a refund.
Prison break lockdown To boring I never played it
