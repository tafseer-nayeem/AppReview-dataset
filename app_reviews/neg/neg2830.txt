Baby games My grandson loves this game but it now only loads half the pg. I've reloaded it but is still not loading all the pg. Plzfix
Unsatisfied Downloaded it for my 16mo old grandson and there were ads WHY IS THERE ADS on a baby app game 
Boring The balloon pop is the only thing that interests my 8 month old. I only need it for a very short amount of time so it works for me. May not work for others who want to keep their child distracted longer than 5 minutes
