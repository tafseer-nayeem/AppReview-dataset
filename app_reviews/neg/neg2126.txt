New update The new update has messed up the game sounds. I get to hear the turkey gobble yay, but the sound that plays when it is my turn is gone.Love the game.  Please fix the sound.
They want you to buy more money to play with idiots This game they have a bunch of idiots Harass you, cheaters who table talk and under bidders and this spades game does nothing, its a joke, and there all Rookie players.
Good game but I guess they assume we should take a snap shot after every game, if you don't get paid for winning, there's no way you can tell if you get paid till after,  the treasure box doesn't open all times when it supposed to,   the game is fun, just wish what they offer works.  If it weren't for my friends I made, I would delete it
Spades plus I have been playing the game for a few weeks now , But for the last three days it tells me there is a problem connecting , I uninstalled then re reinstall it ,still not connecting what is happening .
The option of going 0 and blind nil ruin the game Too many people just go 0 everytime it ruins the game cause they have books and screw the strategy part of the game up you should have to be down by a hundred before you can go zero or blind nil
Cant connect It wont let me connect facebook the whole app freeze i have to keep uninstalling an reinstall. Inly can play as guest.
