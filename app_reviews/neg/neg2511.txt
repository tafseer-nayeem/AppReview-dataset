The fielders move so slow that's g I gave u 2 stars and whenever i play and match the game exits automatically abd its not like it is shown...
Just did not liked it It is not the game you are looking for the screen shots are just fake  just dont download
No ball The player spelling is not correct no commentary and the bowler balls no ball in every over I played 15 over game the opposite team balls 56 no balls which is irritating because the balls count on batsman innings but not shoe in a match
Can't resume my game When i press resume button it start from beginning. Another bowling problem, i can only take wicket by catch. No LBW or no Bowled, no edge....
Good but so many advertisment comes between th game and its very irritating so i m uninstalling This ...Plz work on it.......
Great game but.. Great game but many times i hit six it count it as a ball without six amd players move as they are standing like dummy and moves no movment in them only when they get to the ball they move. Fix this and i will rate it 5 star.
