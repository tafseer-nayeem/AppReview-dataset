Reports many fewer steps than Walked Logger. By 3550  I don't know how this happens, as they are on same phone, and I entered the same calibration factors, both with highest sensitivity. After a few days, it stopped altogether. Uninstalling.
Never count steps with screen off. Its either always Stop or always Start. Even when running in background, it stops counting steps. Would definitely uninstall it.
