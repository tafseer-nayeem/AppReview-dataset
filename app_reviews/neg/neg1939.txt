Waited to long to refund Wouldnt be a bad game if you didnt need to spend money to get anywhere. Pro tip dont charge for the game if you have required in app purchases.
Can't even play
Inapp purchases No thanks. Game seems mildly entertaining at best. I soon as I boot it up, it's trying to sell currency to me. I can see where this is going, so no thank you.
NO REFUND there use to be a refund now there's. not
sucks
