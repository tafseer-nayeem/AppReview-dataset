Doesn't work or load properly and the 5 and under age rating is a joke. I played one of the games my daughter was complaining about and it doesn't surprise me that she couldn't figure it out.
It's boring. All you get to do is make a pony and read there story you don't even get to chose there cutie mark
Its does not work This game is complete stupid 
I want my money back This game doesn't work, I want my my money back. Can some please give me a refund
do not get This is a scam  Doesn't load at all
DOES NOT WORK
Waste I threw 4.30 in the bin. This game is rubbish in the bin. Asoulute RUBBISH
Hate it I want a refund
Sucks
Waste of money There is no point in getting this game. All the game did was offer 3 clips of how each pony got her cutie mark and then repeat the first clip again and again. Pretty much you sit through buffering so you can try and make a pony to represent you that looks nothing like you
I did the whole thing in less than 30 minutes Seriously All that for nothing Incredibly boring.
Doesn't work at all The game doesn't work at all It loads half way then freezes  would like a refund
Sucks U can't do anything but earn a dumb cutie mark good thing I got a refund
