GPS would not lock in I have the HTC One and it kept saying my GPS was not enabled.  Well, it was enabled because I used my Scout and Google Maps just fine
Only works coming from the Paia We came in the back way to Hanawhich I recommend, hardly anyone on the road, some parts unpaved though   and this app was rendered completely useless.    It did not automatically talk based on our GPS coordinates.  Waste of money
Does not work right at all the GPS literally said we were in the ocean
