Vlc controls don't work I have the updated app and Windows server on Windows 10 and vlc controls don't work. I can see the title name on phone of clip playing, but can't control anything. All the other choices work like basic input, power,netflix, plex... Please fix.
Dislike it Not bad, but support is painfully slow ages to get a reply and is constantly excusing itself with alleged unusually high traffic newsflash if you're constantly experiencing unusually high traffic, it's not unusual anymore, get more personnel and stop making up excuses and can't control Windows volume from Android Wear Seriously WTF, so virtually useless to me. Updates after updates and still the same old huge limitation.
piece of crap . installed and seemed to work fine ... after a restart of my desktop, would not work. reinstalled desktop app and android app still nothing ... how do I get my money back
Wake on lan Loved this app, but now my main use for it has stopped working. Can no longer wake on lan, have to use another app after I've paid for this one
Windows 10 Android update Doesn't work after the combination of update 3.5.1 on play store and windows 10 upgrade on my side. Server appears to be on but not detectable by my device
