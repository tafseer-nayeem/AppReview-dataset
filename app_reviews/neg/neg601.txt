While the game can be fun at times, I experienced a lot of rage quit, especially on the levels that should've been easier. And don't get sucked into paying for extra apps. Would not have been as mad if I could've scored two or more stars. But to pay  inapps then only get one star on the level ... not happy. Done with this and Candy Crush. Also, don't expect the game to be the same on Facebook.
Notified there was a new challenge but after 2 weeks of waiting and a ciiple if updates GAME IS STILL BROKEN Seems like ever since they were sold their games and support stink. If they don't fix it I will have no choice but to start uninstalling ALL King games. Not worth the hassle.  Used to REALLY like their games.
Stops unexpectedly UNinstalling, new version just as frustrating with crashes as old version. Fix and I'll try again. Installed ''new version'' 111315, same result , very disappointed      Finish a game, app quits. Restart, can't get it to open or it opens and crashes when I click on level. Please fix. Will give 5 stars, love to play, hate the crashes.
No sound I just updated and have been playing for a long time. But this new update just killed the sound. Hope it's a glitch but if not, please fix
It won't load This game will not load on my Nook. I have played it for a long time and love it but can't play it anymore. I have emailed customer support and they don't respond. I have tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling it to no avail. I'm sad I can't play it anymore.
Bubble witch I dun really enjoy d game as it requires a lot of money to spend in order to go to next level everytime.
Crash after crash Since last update the game just crash over and over again and its always the fu ing facebook connection request.
Event Disappeared Playing the latest event with 12 hours to go, and the event just disappeared I've been connected the whole time.
