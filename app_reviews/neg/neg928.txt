Discrepancy in app I keep failing the test. Then I found that the exact same question with the exact same roadsign is given with the exact same answers, but then I review whr I failed  discovered that the answers to the exact same question are different. WILL GIVE BETTER RATING IF THIS BUG IS FIXED A.S.A.P.
Its great The app is great but why not choose the language you would like to write the test in.Would love to write in afrikaans my home language.
Not impressed Not what I expected  data wasted
