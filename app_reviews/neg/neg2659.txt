Latest Update has messed up Have used this app for a long time in both IoS and Android. Since the latest update, I can no longer download puzzles, and I have lost my account.
Update killed it S6 and Tab s Telegraph crosswords wont update anymore I have checked my telegraph account onli e and all is well but app wont download them. Please fix it
Used to be great But now I can't download new nyt puzzles... Would be 5 stars without this issue
No service, no response 3 days, no downloads. Their website is even down. Looks like they took the money and ran.
Download Issues Installed on new galaxy tab and it will not download puzzles........I get the same 40 old puzzles.
Loved this app. Until now. Just upgraded my phone, can't create a new account, can't get the same providers that I enjoyed before, or even update the providers. Truly dissatisfied with whatever has happened.
Lowering to 1 star until they fix whatever issue is going on that's preventing NY Times accounts from authenticating and downloading.
Update useless With latest update, no longer downloads any new puzzles. It has become useless.
Strange keyboard behavior Keep getting symbol keys. Nexus 4 wAndroid 5.0.1
