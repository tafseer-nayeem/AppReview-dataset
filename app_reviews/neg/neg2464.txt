Kemco games suck My game never force closed while playing.  I just haven't played for a couple of months. When i tried to play recently all my data was gone, not do to any force closing by my phone, but due to whatever happened on their end. Now they won't refund any of the money I spent on this game, even tho it was their mistake. Never gonna play this or any other Kemco game again, they are nothing but a bunch of thieves.
