Ridiculous The computer takes the same 3 steps, rolls 4 up a ladder, rolls 4 up another ladder, the 6 to the finish.. It's the same every single time I've played it
Ok game The computer keeps making sure that it wins everytime I roll the dice it lands on a snake but when the computer roll the dice it's always missing the snake so I think it's fixed
It was a boring It was do what it likes to do
Cheating When we play with computer only one time we win afterward all games win by computer
Hated it Why does the computer wins and gets ladder while me is snakes so unfair that's ridiculous
It is not good The computer always win it is so unfair
Computer cheats too much. No one is that lucky to hit the big ladder everytime
Deepthi.k I don't like this game why means its not interest game
This is injustice l o l, worst game I always end up on snake and computer always on ladder lolzz.you gave favour to computer, so that people will play your game more and more but you are wrong, keep equal amount of opportunity. Choose random number not the database predefined ladder number for computer
