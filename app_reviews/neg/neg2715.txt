Deleted ALL of my progress  ARE YOU KIDDING ME 2 days after I purchased the full version, it deleted ALL of my progress What gives No reason,  if this continues it will be the last time I purchase from here         It's been one month since I wrote the above review. I completed almost all of the levels with a perfect score, and when I went on it today everything had reset again this is very aggravating does anyone know why this keeps happening
Not good When I reached above level 20 it always ask me to upgrade it but I don't want to upgrade it and when I want to play level 21 it is not allowing me to play it and always asking me to upgrade it so please fixxxxxxxxxxxx it otherwise I will not download it again please fix it  then  I will give 5 stars C
Can't upgrade after already paid for I played and upgraded this game on my old phone, downloaded on my new phone and even though it says I already paid for it.... I can't upgrade. Almost feel like demanding a refund
Not worth it I was so glade to find a game that was so fun and then after level 20 it makes me pay not as fun now as it was that needs to be fixed because I  Am not paying for something that said it was free............epic fail
