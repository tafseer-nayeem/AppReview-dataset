Poop I bought the full version and next day it won't let me do all spots FIX THIS DARN GAME
Suck I its a bad game
Hate it My daughter says mommy I want a better game to play and that makes me feel weird because my daughter usually doesn't have problems with these types of games
Idk mean I don't know Its alright I guess my daughter keeps bugging me
Game never unlocked and customer service never answered. I paid to unlock this game and the game never unlocked. When I tried to contact customer service, no one answered my emails. Extremely unsatisfied.
Hate it This is so wrong You get the game free but have to pay for additional play The game looks cool and all but then unless you're willing to pay you have to quit. People who made this are really tricking kids HATE IT P.S. my friend told me this, so I don't want to play it. You shouldn't either.
Millie rose You are stupid just because other games like it doesn't mean rate it 5 it said based on your opinion not other games opinions
So stupid. Not worth downloading. You can not do much of anything on this game unless you pay with real cash.
Not that great Yes I agree its a super cute game but its not all free you need to pay with real cash to get grandparents etc And why can't u name the baby Also nappy changes happen way to many times its ridic
It won't work I have an Android One touch Fierce 2 and it is not working. As soon as I tap the app it stops. Fix and I'll give 5 stars.
Very upset and angry I just purchased the 4.99 package and didnt get squat... I feel like I just got robbed... this is why I dont like purchasing things via Google
