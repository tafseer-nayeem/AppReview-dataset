Out 2 My daughter loves this game but I definitely don't think its worth 1.99. The same things over and over and you can't choose which games to play just whatever comes up. I'm disappointed to say the least.
Doesn't work Three screens in it stops working. How much more do I pay to get one that will actually work
UuGggHhhhh I've had this app for 2 weeks and IT STILL DOESN'T LOAD TO THE GAME  All me and my four year old get is a loading screen.............
Not worth
Not all games working On my gen 1 nexus 7 and lollipop not all the games work. Some just start the leave an empty screen.
Bought full version but not opening
Loading.... App just hangs on the loading screen forever and never actually starts.
Stopped running Installed recently and it does not work, problem with the latest update. Loads and only get a black screen. Fix and will give it higher rating.
It doesn't open on my device please give me a refund
