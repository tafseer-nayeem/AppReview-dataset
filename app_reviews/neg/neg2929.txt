Worst game ever I think this is the worst game ever I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone, most of the pets are not even properly injured and once you cure them there is nothing else to do. I think this game should be free so people don't waste their money.
Eh It's sweet to see all the pets feel better at the end ' I'm an animal lover' but other than that this game is soo boring, lame and stupid. Toca boca creators please make this free so people don't have to waste there money
Doesn't work on a restricted profile I have a 'safe' profile set up using the built in android functionality, but this game will not load up on it. Unfortunately that means its a 0 star, nonestarter for me
