Unreliable and slow. I downloaded easytether after another app crashed several times. Easytether is only barely more stable, but peaks at not even 200Kbs, while pdanet has easily hit 5Mbs. Very unimpressed with this purchase.
does not work save your money
Fails to  allow Internet access. Does not work Even from the time purchased, it was not working.  Hope something changes.
It works for everything except Steam. If I am trying to download anything through steam the connection drops down to less than 100 kbps and stays that way until i disconnect and reconnect. Will do it again if i try to use steam. Fix this issue and I'll 5 star
