Poorly designed. Got sick of the optical illusion where I'd see one colored ball ready to shoot but then a different color comes out.
Buggy,ugly on tablet Feels terrible and slow to respond to taps, balls dissappear or fly in the opposite direction you shoot them sometimes. Ads are not super noticable so good on that. Game is playable but not enjoyable on my tablet.
Bubble shooter glitches Waaay too many glitches. Some levels are designed for you to lose many times over. Don't like how it calls you a loser when you lose a level rather than just say lose. Would be lots more fun once all these are corrected.
stoopid glitch i hate it when the the bubble sticks to another. and i cant see the blue one. HATE THIS GAME. YOU DONT DESERVE A STAR. UNINSTALLING THIS GAME
Nice Tell me how to play 90level I Am asking about Creater of the game have you played 90level
Lousy App development Bland sounds, Ugly UI theme that looks like it was developed in stone age, game lags even on higher end phones. Not worth installing.
What color The bubble will change colors after you shoot it. I thought maybe. I was seeing it wrong, but I wasn't. Also looks grainy and cheap. Poor quality app
Expecting Much Better Graphics are off, and the add's are annoying.
Nice... Good ... Mind is addicted to this...
Game balks  refuses to work, but the ads certainly keep on just fine Uninstalled
Hated it a lot Cant complete level 90.Anything I do says looser
Good but.......... The picture quality of the game is too low. So pleade do some favour for me.
Not good Whoever installed this game is a loser first. Well you can't change the bubbles. So, this game sucks and i especially don't like if you lose the game it calls you a loser and for that matter don't even let me call a winner. There are so much better games than this.
