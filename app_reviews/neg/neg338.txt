Simple  suggestion Lower the shard requirement for evolution. more ways to earn HB ,and increase chance of getting legends ....also make upgrades for elites and ordinary hero atleast on a defensive front ....this game can reach heights if legends are king ,and elites ,ordinary are troops of castle
Nice app but......... Castle Clash is a nice app but can't get more gems  more legendary heroes more golds more manas but please you can add some rewards in the Daily rewards like gem pack gold pack mana pack and more special hero cards

Paying customer issue. Dont spend any money in this game In my case delivery was late and I lost my chances on event. 20 wasted Had to wait for almost a day for customer service  to tell me that theres nothing they can do.
Tries to earn free gems 350 apps install....that's my free gems, downloaded over 50 apps and run to get gems but the gems won't increase after 2 or 3 apps that give gems, the rest it won't give anything. ...........daily free gems CAP
Pumpkin duke Pls give more lucky to get PD .. Everyone need PD .. I'm 50 might, still don't get PD .. I buy with gems still no get. No PD no team want friendly fight together .. Plsss fix T.T
Two years of playing but still no pumpkin duke This game doesn't deserve my 5 stars anymore
