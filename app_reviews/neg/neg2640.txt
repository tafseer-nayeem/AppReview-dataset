Cant believe all the good reviews None of the words make sense together snail face its all random crap. Why doesn't the playstore show how many uninstalled apps
Bull I've had to buy SO many hints to progress and now I'm stuck as the way the letters are there is no way I can get this last word. Refund my money for my hints as I can no longer use them if I can't progress
Could be better... Words sequences make no sense and you only get hints by solving puzzles. I am on one now and I've used every 3 letter word I know and none are right I wanted something to challenge me, not frustrate me and make me feel stupid. I will be uninstalling and looking for a new game 
Too many bugs Slow to open, and slow responses in game. On opening the app, ads come up that will not go away.  Gameplay is challenging and kind of fun when you can get to it, but not worth the aggravation. Will be deleting.
Don't particularly care that the game resets itself when app is closed, once hints are used up, your only option is to purchase more
