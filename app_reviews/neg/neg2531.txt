Memory  money I bought this game for 2.99 last night was enjoying it loving it, until I paid another 2.99 for coins on this game went to bed last night. I woke up this morning to play and it made me start completely over it stole my money I wouldn't buy this game its stupid and worthless.
Restore button doesn't work I had to factory reset phone after installing game I tried using the ingame restore button to unlock my ingame items and nothing happened lock is still on the addons I paid for.
Deletes game even if I hit save
Spent quite a bit of money on this game and now it will not even open...it wants me to pay even more money for the 2016 version
Srsly you made it free I want a refund I want my money back and if I don't get it  back I'll do something bad 
Great detail but. Like I was saying this game has great detail but don't like having to look down at the game. Needs someway to be able to see more a head of you. Can't see the turns on the road till your right on it.  Kinda slow going.
Needs property update The fencing, rocks, etc get in the way of the autopilot feature. If you spend money on the bigger tractors, you should be able to use them without this frustration. Otherwise, love this sim.
REFUND PLEASE guyz do not buy this game i bought it and it wxpects u to buy the newest version this is trash dont ge it
Glitches Can't restore purchases will give5 stars when that works
I will give it five stars if you unlock every thing
Lost my game I had a 600,000 coin game that I had played 40 plus hours on and after the update I have lost that game so if you can get this back I will rate 5 stars
Ok At first its fun. After a while it gets really boring. I wish I can have a refund I spent like 10 bucks on money and 3 bucks on the game. Honestly if you have a busy life don't buy this it gets boring. And a waste of money
