I can not play Second Life correctly I can not use any of the Second Life keyboard short cuts correctly the required keys do other stuff on Android so this is not much use to me. Also due to the Android OS only allowing for one mouse button I was unable to use the correct commands needed by pressing the 'right' mouse button.
In serious need of updating The viewer is really in need of updating, it does not handle mesh very well at all, for example, the Uti Kemono shows up stretched and T posed in world.. No support for built in AO either
Crashes sometimes Cant join groups. It stops working alot and force closes. Im unable to get on it says it cant connect to the server when i do manage to get on its laggy
Paying for service of a viewer that you assume would be able to stay logged in Instead I keep getting logged out when I attempt to either teleport to another area in sl. Or when I attempt to go into my inventory to change outfits great quality viewing but poor connection status with my LG phone
