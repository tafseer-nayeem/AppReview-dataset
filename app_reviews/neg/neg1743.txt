Useless Does not work in Melbourne
Nice
How to edit the speed limit Some speed limits are wrong can't  edit them. I added som cameras but not showing in updates.
Didn't realise I had to input the camera locations. Or hope someone else did. Would be great if it was already programmed where they are. That's what I thought it was like. If it's not a fixed camera it won't always be there.
Got six tickets for over speed last time when I went to Thiruvananthapuram Kerala with this app on. HAD TO PAY 2400 RUPEES AS FINE... pEOPLE...dONT TRUST THIS COMPLETELY.
