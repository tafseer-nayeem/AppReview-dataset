Fack app plzz dnt waste ur MB  Time Showing different different BP value of a single person at a one time.
Fake app I think this is a fake application. I just do quich touch. And this appliaction show some resulth
Useless As you can see by most of responses most people believe that this is real, there is no responsble person who could class this as a prank because it is obvious by 1 comment he uses it instead of a bp monitor and most others do. Most people are gullible and the creator who has no brains,should know this is extremely dangerous. Not in the least funny and  play store should not allow these types of apps to be  laid out....
Horrible The stupidest,horrible and worst app ever
Fack app Telling different different bp of a same person at a same time.Don't waste your MB and Time on this app.
it's a good app but I don't know how much time touch the finger on saccaning
Waste This is a application for wasting time. By simple scanning of finger we cont find the appropriate values. As a doctor i dont suggest this. I suggest to use automated BP machine for day 2 day users.
finger blood pressure prank It's good for me and my family
