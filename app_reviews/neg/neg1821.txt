Uh I'm not sure if it's servers but Zedge isn't updating new pictures like it use to. I haven't seen a new background in at least one month. Hope you fix it thin I'll give it's 5 stars. It might be my phone, or a bug on this certain device but plz check it out, I have a Galaxy S4 mini.
Zedge still doesn't work for my phone since 3 months ago Your damn app still isn't working even after I have already complained to you guys about it
Why If I search Fallout, I get no wallpapers, but if my buddy searches the same thing on his iPhone version he gets a bunch. What gives.
I understand you need profits, and show ads, fine. But an ad I can't close, not mute That's why people block them. Stahp it  Again Still with the fullscreen autoplaying full volume ads Adblocker it is  Update 111815 now with notification spam
