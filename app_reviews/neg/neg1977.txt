Touchy Controls, Frustrating Too difficult to play on a 5 inch screen phone, maybe iPad is better, but wish I hadn't bought this. Too frustrating to play.
Laggy and slow down I have been having a lot of slow down on this, but it use to run perfectly.
Please Read I have gotten sonic 1 and 2... They had the same problems. They both crashed when the Sega logo appears. I have a ''Asus Android Memo Tablet'' And I would like an email sometime telling me whenif , their will be an update to fix this problem. When its fixed, I will gladly rate 5 stars and write a good review. Thanks and fix please
