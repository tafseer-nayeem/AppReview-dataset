So badly done. How are kids supposed to enjoy this with all the popup ads and links the app store so stupidly placed on the home screen Please lose tje ads and hide the other links in a settings menu tucked away feom the play area, so little fingers can enjoy tje game, without going to dodgy sites and accidentaly installinguninstalling my other apps.
Bloody terrible. Kid touched screen and an add with bare woman's ass came on screen. How does these people live with themselves. An app for kids with adult content. Bloody disgraceful. I'll be reporting this to play store. Pegi 3 I think not.
Some of background voice speak funny English they should learn better how to talk.
So i uninstalled Its kids app app should have sense not to allow adult advertisement in it this is very disappointing
Animal sounds The animal marked as a skunk is not a skunk
all advertising what a shame.  this app makes me mad because of all the advertising.  so annoying.
