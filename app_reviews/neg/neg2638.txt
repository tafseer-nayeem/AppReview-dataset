i love the game but giving it one star cause it keeps bugging me to rate it if u have faith in ur app u dont need to keep begging me to rate it ill rate it on my own if its good enough
Unplayable It types out the riddle and then zooms in so you can't read the last sentence. And there is no way to quit.
Can't Play I installed the app with intentions to play but every time I launch it, it force closes .. I'll re rate this game when the problem is fixed.
