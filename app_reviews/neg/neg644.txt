Dont waste your time No bonuses. Spun 300x and nothing. Cheap wins, and free spins dont pay out IF you get any. Not worth the time to play
MAD If you really pay attention to receiving your payout from each winning, you might be getting cheated.  I have already lost 20 thousands coins.  This is a huge problem.  Someone needs to fix it immediately and give me my winnings.
Rip off Bought a chip package did not teceive chips playtika non responsive no refund . My advice swerve this one
Samsung G.G.Neo Bug After the install, the phone restarted. Now i cant uninstall this app, it reatarts my phone every time. Had to backup all the stuff, and do a factory reset. All alright after the reset. I then downloaded it again, just to make sure, and still the same problem. I hope it'll be fixed soon
SUCKS I Thought Vegas was bad. The other reviews on here don't lie. I Downloaded this game and in 7 minutes im uninstalling it. I hit 40 free spins and 1 bounus and only won 2000 credits betting 825 hahhhahahahahhaa
I hate this game Cheater all the way I was cheated and i realizd i was addicted to this game.  I spent a lot to bet big and win big but no pay out.  Poor app...  I should review the comments before i downloaded it.. Too late
Hate hate hate Hate hate hate hate
Boring This game is horrid. It is just a game and you can not do much with it. The loose to win ratio is horrid so you never have coins to play unless you buy them. What ever happened to the fun simple games without micro transactions....
Scam and full of glitches This game is full of glitches and probably rigged too wouldnt pay the 5 day bonus times 5 then get 3 wild symbols in the middle row of the first 3 columns wont pay same thing with other games wrote to playtika and their only response was asking for screenshots making it out like i totally made this up. A scam i say , wouldnt waste time on this bloody scam 
Not worth playing Your to slow loading then about every third spend you lose wifi connection and its not on my end,your payouts are stupid most times less than one quater of what you spend so why play it,theres other free games that payout better,keep the connection and is more fun to play without being slow.

Cheats you on points if you have it on auto spin I just downloaded this game and have already counted over 10 times it has screwed me out of points wilds then whole screens of color and they didn't pay me it just kept spinning I will never buy coins from this game for free it's ok but what a joke figure your game out and people might buy your coins
Garbage Sister site ti slotomania. No bonus, no free games no wins. Just want your money. Sad and boring.
Rip off Bought coin package, paid for coin package. Error happened in phone had to reinstall slots. Coins weren't in my account. All happened in less than 45 minutes.
Was a great app not anymore deleting PLAYSTORE apps the WORST  The data usage isn't worth it anymore u don't win here week after week stay on a level 2 to 3 weeks the wheel is WORTHLESS deleting soon maybe one day will DOWNLOAD them again  Now play daily bonus to bonus no fun bonuses free spins payouts are really terrible.
Nico Crap bonuses no wins odds are useless after playing it a few times I wouldn't play it again it's a cool games just so so Un developed
Design flaws Once I got the bonus round on Kings Of Gold and the screen went funny. It was inverted and backed me out of my bonus game. So back to the majn menu and I lost my bonus round NOT HAPPY
No wins Same old story. Win for a couple of rounds then brutally loose going forward. The games would be a lot better if they actually paid out. Don't waste your time
Purchased coins 3 times and app stopped after payment accepted. No coins received. Very disappointed. Contacted customer service , no reply. Enjoyed game, but app kept stopping and didn't provide bought coins.

No Viber connect bonus I downloaded Viber jus to connect for the bonus and it continually starts to let me approve then won't load that's unethical then I tried to buy coins my payment was taken but again no coins slottomania does the same guess playtika shud b called scamtika
Dumb game. Waste of time. Don't lose real money on fake coins How stupid,
Seriously dont waste your time Worst pay outs, 2 bonus back to back didnt even make my spin back. Literally 20 of people that download this hate it... Look at the stats.
