Not collecting earned Rewards... I earned coins and power ups,  but they didn't add it to my other coins and power ups.  Rip off...
keeps crashing the game won't start anymore. it just keeps crashing during the Rovio logo.
Angry birds pop App won't open keeps say unfortunately app has stopped I'm on level 45 and now I can platform it
Pay for play At the beginning it was fun but as you go through the levels it becomes too hard and you'll be forced to wait or pay to keep playing and get power ups.
Never should of downloaded it... This game is stupid dont download it when I get on level 14 it just stopes this just goes on main screen please get fixed.
Concept is cool but... The stupid balls do not go where the line says it goes somewhere you don't want it to go..pretty much the shooter part kills the game
The gameplay is fine, but Rovio are destroying privacy. There's no stinking excuse for the permissions they want on this app.  Use a permissionrevoker to control spyware crap like this or simply don't install it at all.
The Samsung galaxy s5 is not compatible for the new update. I'm very disappointed I play this game every day.
Third time is NOT a charm After each of the last 3 updates, app will not open and I've lost all my progress most recently at Level 201. I've been told only way to resolve problem is to uninstall and start over. Very, very unhappy and will being sharing displeasure with everyone I possibly can.
Abpop It's a pretty good game i haven't had any problems yet, but i would like to know what do the gold feather stands for and it stops working when i try to go into Facebook
