Hmm Would have been a better rating had I not been forced to do a rating for my daughter to be able to color. Options were rate or close...not cool in my opinion..NOWW each time I open the app it only let's me come rate..even though I already did and does not continue to app. Grr
Rated but still asking to rate Some what interested.
More stuff Needs more colors and more details
Doesn't like to go past rate me
Freezes constantly This app freezes or quits, or just stops coloring constantly.  Awful.
Dunno I have not tried it yet because it won't let me until I rate it so... I'm not sure
Hat I hat it nothing to do
