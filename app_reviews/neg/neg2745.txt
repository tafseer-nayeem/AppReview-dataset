Update is bad. Toooo hard Kids are playing this, let them win. It is way too hard. The monkey doesn't respond.
Kids love the show Hate the game.  You have to use the tilt feature.  And it sucks. I'm a 40 year old man been gaming since I was ten and i can get it to work right.  Should be free but nope 3 bucks.  Very disappointed.  And so are my kids.
Too hard for little ones. Great show, app stinks.
This game rocks
