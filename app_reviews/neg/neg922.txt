Having problems with editingdeleting foods added.  It added things twice one with counts one without.  How about including measurements and weight tracking and goal per day tracking to foods eaten
Unsupported Looks like they abandoned this in July. Added food does not show up in day or overview. Functionally useless.
Crap app Freezes all the time and never gives user a chance to input meals. Rather download fatsecret app...way better than this waste of data
Seems like some of you got no idea what Beta means...
Not working Can't add food items. Not loading and saving anything.
Not opening It comes up with an error 
Rubbish app. Wasted my time and data
Di W Did not even accept the first food I tried to log in.
Downloaded it. Can't open it. Says unfortunately bant stopped working. Waisted my data.
Tried it Meal tracker is broken, no food shows up when you search.  If they fix this issue I would be happy to try app again.
No tracking ability This app doesn't allow you to input food items or meals. After entering a food item in the search bar, the only option is to cancel but there's no search button. It makes this app useless because it won't show macros because nothing is being tracked. Please fix this
Such a pity I am on the trial version of this programme online and was thrilled when I saw the app But I downloaded it twice and both times the app didn't even open. What a disappointment
App not even working Rubbish. Wasted my time and data.
