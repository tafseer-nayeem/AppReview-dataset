Good but not great
This used to be a great game but there is a bug in it so I can't move cards from the right hand column Amy more
Horrible I'm left handed. The add is on the left. So every card I move opens the add.  Uninstalled.
 One suit only. No option to change
It freezes constantly on my galaxy note 4 since the last update. I hate this app now.
