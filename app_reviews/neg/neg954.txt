I get Ads in notification on phone. Does not let me sent the message. When I press on the mail icon nothing happens.
Galaxy s6 edge  moto 360 gen 2 Since the update I can't send messages...I've tried restarting both my phone and watch, also tried uninstalling and reinstalling
Notifications  Facebook don't work Paid for quick replies to Facebook and texts, no notifications and Its done nothing to Facebook notifications
Certain keyboards come without a delete button That's a little ridiculous.
Won't Sync I have tried all the trouble shoots from the website but I can't get it to sync to my watch.
Moto 360 I am unable to reply my whatsapp message using the keyboard...
Not happy with this app. Paid for it and no keyboard, like the picture shows.
New feedback Sorry but I have the moto360 and when I type in words it gets cut out by the round edges of the watch can you bring it in a bit
No group convos I really like the idea of the app but it doesn't show your group conversations only individual ones
I paid for the app how come its now asking me to pay again I cant even turn off notifications on my phone until I pay again either WTF When I try to uncheck show new messages it tries to get me to pay again, this is absolutely CRAZY that I cannot turn this off until paying AGAIN. I dont mean to sound too angry but this is very slimy for a developer and hope its a glitch.
