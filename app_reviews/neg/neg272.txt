DO NOT INSTALL I have My Radar on all my other devices, 5 iOS 8.x and 5 Windows 8.1 and Mobile 8.1 updates 1 and 2. I have bought upgrade packages and never once had issue with My Radar or any devices, really like the app First Android device, Lollipop 5.1.1, and the app hooked itself so deep into the OS that when I unchecked local forecast notifications I lost Google services connectivity and the battery analyzing was laid waste, even if I was able to get Now services apparently working.
Notifications Cost Money I decided to download an app to be alerted of unusual weather in my area. After downloading this app is when I found out it is not free but most notifications I wanted to turn on cost between 24 each
BROKEN  BLUETOOTHWiFi CONFLICT A formerly great app but RUINED when Bluetooth added. Conflict with WiFi causes crippled WiFi speeds and droppedmissed phone calls. Never fixed in any v4 release. Awful
Quick This was the fastest weather app I have ever used. I had to remove it because my Samsung Galaxy 5 reboots every time I open it with the last update.
Battery life took huge hit If lose 40 battery while sleeping over night with this app.
I've loved this app in the past, why does it now need to use my Bluetooth
