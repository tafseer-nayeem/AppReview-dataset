Difficult to operate Cards are too tight to move. Can't pick up easily half the column of arranged cards when needed. I have to click drag 3 or 4 times to pick up sometimes. No option of HINT.   No double click to send the card to nearby match.            Needs a lot of development and that Hint button
Freezes up I get annoyed when the games freezes up while playing or if you respond yo a text you get a white screen.  At that time all I can do is restart my phone.  This is my favorite game to play so I hope they fix soon
Automatically counts a loss Every time I reply to a text or answer a call, it counts as a loss. I love spider solitaire on my computer. But, here it has too many glitches. Fix it soon or I will be uninstalling.
