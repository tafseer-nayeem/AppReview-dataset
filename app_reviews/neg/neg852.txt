Devs need to listen. Ok let's be honest. The new look sucks. Many of us will NOT get used to it. Furthermore asking me to unlock features, I have already paid for previously is BS. Go back to the old app and get over yourselves.
Best financial calculator, but the new look keyboard is truly crap. Bring back the original HP calculator look, please
Recent update Sorry, the new look is horrible.  It's hard to read and not nearly as good as the old look.
Don't like the upgrade Went backward on the graphics
