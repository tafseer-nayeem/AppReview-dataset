Doesn't even attempt to work with subsonic Its functionality can't even read subsonic info from the notification bar. So dissatisfied and disappointed.
Can't control volume Cannot control sportify volume from my pebble time, pls fix it
UI is superb, but looses connection randomly
I learned too late to get my money back that Music Boss only allows track changes, not album changes.  It is no more useful to me that the default music app.
