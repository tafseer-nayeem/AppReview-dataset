Not too sure I suppose I could see how some of these sounds might put a baby to sleep, but some of them don't sound anything like what they're labeled as. Some sound close, and some are greatly exaggerated, or maybe a better description would be that they sound a bit comical. Either way, I guess it's just OK. I think there are much better apps out there for this purpose, but hey, decent effort anyway guys.
Garbage If you like a screaming baby cuz the app you're using keeps stopping on its own then this is for you. Love the fact that a Purchase App bubble pops up every time you try and set the timer. Of course you can set the timer for how long you want, but apparently the app knows better and turns off when it feels like. I would never spend a cent on this junk.
Free trial Unfortunately this didn't help my baby sleep, but we're also in the beginning stages of sleep training where nothing calms her but the boob lol  I like the variety of sounds... too bad it doesn't play for more than 30 minutes or at least give you a trial of the full features so you can decide if you want to pay.  I also don't like the wierd stutter at the beginning of the music box...like an error in the recording.
