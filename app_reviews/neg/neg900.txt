Why am I running on my bike I use the app for cycling and running so it tracks my miles in my running shoes but the app doesn't clear my running shoes from my bike rides. I have to edit my rides to prevent binge rides from adding miles to my running shoes.   I have submitted this issue twice and the problem is still not fixed. I had the app uninstalled for several weeks but my shoes were still recorded on my first workout bike ride after reinstalling
Why is the ios app better Sat with a friend with an iPhone. .. his app has way more features than mine. Why I love MMR but why should I get a poorer app because I chose a better phone

Narrow equipment support Like the graphic and UI, seems to have tons of 3rd party app, but didn't have hardware support for bluetooth smart sensor e.g. 60beat bike cadence and speed sensor.  Have basic android wear support but no heart rate support
