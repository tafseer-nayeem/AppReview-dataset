Doesn't work.. don't bother with it. Just updated the app, uninstalled it then reinstalled it and it still doesn't log into my account... Think I should get my money back as this app clearly doesn't work properly....
Travelcard prices to white After weeks trying to get my paid version to work again I finally got to sign in today, but now when I click on buy Travelcard it is very hard to see what zone options etc that there are as the text is white on a white background, instead of black text on a white background.
Unreliable This app was great but over the last few months it will not update your account. When you log out and try to sign back in it comes up wrong pass word. It is a complete waste of time trying 
Haven't been able to use this app for weeks , very annoying
Login No excuses Your app is officially useless Cannot log in again Had to go on oyster website to top up Grrrrr. ...
Perfect. No more Why won't it login now I've updated it. This is a recurring issue.
SGS3 Login failed WTF
Login
Just cannot log in......again All was working fine then couldnt log in for a while then it started working...now its stopped accepting my log in details.....poor for a paid app
BUG it get worse It overtakes my telephone, drains my batteries it behaves like a bug. I want my money back. No more apologies excuses etc.  MONEY BACK  PLEASE.
Problems again Once again saying there's a login failure so can't access my balance, etc. Please fix these issues quicker as very frustrating
Pain in the train The app keeps opening, repeatedly, when it's fully closed and I'm not using it. I only use my oyster card about once every 3 months so the almost daily, multiple self opening is a real pain
