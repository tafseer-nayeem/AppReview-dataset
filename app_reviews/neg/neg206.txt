Tangible Sales only A CD with photos IS tangible.. but its ok for ppl to post 1 items only for the price to be in the description at 200  but False ads are ok This app is a JOKE  i will spread the word of this
Looks nicebut.. Will not connect to my Facebook or email and I can log into both no problem with out using it to try and connect to the app. But with out  this I obviously can not contact anyone to buy
They charge way too much People put outrageous prices for used things like no. A person wanted to sell a ps3 for 300 when in the stores its 219.99 and a ps4 is 399.99
These new updates have ruined the app. Everytime I try to post an ad it just keeps loading and never completes. Also, when I open a person's profile it does the same thing. This is getting very annoying, I've tried deleting and uninstalling it again but these problems keep persisting. Please change it to how it was before.
