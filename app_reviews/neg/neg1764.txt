No ship traffic Open app and it is not showing ANY kind of marine traffic.  Tried shutting down my phone and then restart it and still nothing.  Didn't have any problems until I updated the app
Outdated A very poor attempt and a waste of money. You can get more information from the web free. Needs a far better UI. Options are limited and sharing doesn't work.
Inaccurate positions and missing ships I use this app both ashore and on board a ship.  Frequently a ship is shown in an outdated position, even though the app says it was updated in the last few minutes. Additionally it does not reliably show all stations in an area.  I have verified this with other ais sites, and our own data.  Prior to about 4 months ago, this service showed reliable information.  Unfortunately that is no longer the case, at least in the Great Lakes region.
Pls help me My screen is empty i cannot see any thing just a blank screen
