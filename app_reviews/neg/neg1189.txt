Liked the single line version better , the calibration  is way  off on this  and there  isn't enough adjustment  on this version
Used to be pretty good. Now its slow and unresponsive. I love touching anything like a song or the back button then waiting several seconds before something happens. Im shocked qc thought a several second delay on all actions was a positive. I, like everyone else that has this app would want this problem addressed. So annoying when your waiting not knowing if you need to press itvagain or is it just taking acreally long time or what. Just really dumb. Galaxy Note tablet.
