too many glitches Downloaded it on my galaxy note 3 the other day and it was okay, but here's the problems i encountered some of the instructions were confusing... like they came from someone who's first language wasn't English. I got over that, but once you get to the test phase, the screen shows blank blocks where numbers should be. PLEASE FIX
