Get it all free It says have 300 leve. I only played 4 levels it was birdwing fix it . My Valentines. Is great an 8 years old
Limited Levels  Not Free I enjoy these games but it gives you just a few levels then request you to buy the rest.
I give one star because... I've had for six minutes and I'm done with the whole game what the crap add more levels
Very small app I would rate it 5 star if you add more levels.
Looks free BUT you have to pay after afew levels Is fun game but is ruined by deceitful beginnings suggesting it is free when its only a taster to get people to pay.  Just make it a paid app Too much advertising.
Fun, but only 12 levels This had some fun levels, but only 12 of them before I had to buy something.
Wont install Wont let me install the newest update, keeps saying package file was not signed correctly..
Very disappointed  Downloaded this game today because I love the others. It only gave me 12 levels. It asks if I want to download full version... Takes me to original Where's my Water.
Very hard Well,the game is good actually but  the levells were so hard even a 15 year old would have a really hard time and since its valentine theme,even the couple would have been annoyed with this,so next time make it a little bit more easy...no hard feelingsjust some tips
It was fun but, I need to pay, to play more
