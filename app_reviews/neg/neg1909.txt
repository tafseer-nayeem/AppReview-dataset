Coming from a total baby user UI is bad  design not intuitive at all. The reports are meaningless  I've yet to find one that's actually useful. I only use this app because I can change the start time of feeding sessions, although that is not straight forward either. And, after paying for this, I don't appreciate being held hostage to write a review with annoying pop ups and ultimately a big red button on my screen that won't go away until I review.
Don't force me to give you 5 stars. I've already paid for the Pro version now you've placed a red banner across all my screens instructing me to give you 5 stars to remove it....
