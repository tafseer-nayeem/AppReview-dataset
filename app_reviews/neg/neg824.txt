I cannot take a picture The concept of the app very cool but the only thing I dislike is that whenever I take a picture the whole screen turns gray. I tried to screenshot it but that just takes the makeup effect off. Please fix I WILL GIVE FIVE STARS IF FIXED
Facing problems The app isn't placing the key points accurately at all. N after I adjust it manually, the face shaping option becomes absolutely useless. Also how do I save the picture with original resolution Pls help.
