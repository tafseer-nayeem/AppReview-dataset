There is no reason for a simple word game to have network access. I side load a lot of my Google play games to my Kindle and this is one that doesn't work. Very unhappy about that
Needs a nonmisogynistic Australian version. Relies heavily on American terminology and spelling, so bear this in mind when comparing your scores with others. Also, it loses a star for linking dumb and broad.
I hate it
Good game It's a great game I love playing it. But it crashes and then won't load anymore... I've tried un installing and re installing and I loose everything then the same thing happens again... kinda wish I hadn't paid for it..
Hey it doesn't work anymore... Won't open anymore .
