My piano At first I thought this game was going to be the best game ever but after a while it started to get boring so if you want to install this game pleas read this because you will regret it
wtf kind of crap is this  i press 1 key 3 times and either different sounds come each time or all of the keys on the keyboard plays the same tone. seriously, you call yourself a developer 
Notes don't play correctly Will not advise you to download this app, even the basic notes don't play properly..

I wish there would be a bigger octave range I don't know a single song out of the basics that use less than 2 octaves. Its extremely frustrating.
