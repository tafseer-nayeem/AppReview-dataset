Glitching bad I would give five stars . I love this game but keeps glitching bad.. Please fix
Songpop Would rate it better if the sound didn't keep cutting out during games
I WANT ONE DIRECTION Even 5sos have their own playlist why not 1D
Fix the bugs Sound AFTER song selection, sometimes no sound on songs, 0 second full points if waiting until song ends and selecting correct answer, etc etc... Android 6.0 on Nexus 7 2013.
Stopped working All i get is the loading screen now Shame great app.. u need to sort this problem
Annoyed Hadn't played song pop in a couple years. Super annoying that you can't delete challenges. There are games from literally 2 years ago. Obviously they aren't playing anymore so I should be able to delete it..
Sucks Wont let me select the song i want when im in a challenge. So i lose the challenge to my opponent.
songpop its. a. fun. game. I. give. it. five. stars. thank. you
