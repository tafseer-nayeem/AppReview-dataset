Sync doesn't work properly Bought the app as the free version looked good but needed to sync the list with my wife. Both of us have same issue on multiple phones every time you exit the app it loses the sync settings. When you go back in you have to setup sync again. Money wasted on an app that doesn't work.
Disappointed After almost a year since last update, not big change. Was expecting meal planner, categories for recipes, something that I could see the difference. Still the best app, but if you not improving, sooner or later there will be somebody else who takes what you did and add all the things we are asking for months . BTW I deleted and amended aisle tag in previous version. So this isn't new.
Support Seems To Be Missing In No Action Tried to email support 3 times, can't,  mail folder is full. Found another email address and no response.  I'm done and will look for a different app. I sure as hell won't pay for the next one. Will also request the Play Store to take the pay version down due to no support.
Empty Promises Was promised a web interface in the fall of 2012 and we are still waiting... The developer now ignores any request or inquiry regarding the web interface.
Good App HOWEVER REALLY DISAPPOINTED Good App HOWEVER REALLY DISAPPOINTED that I spent almost a week adding in inventory and then the app stops working ...then EVERY SINGLE THING I DID GONE Really an app that you like put that much time into to make things organized and no sync not worth buying because it will seriously end up wasting your time in the end
