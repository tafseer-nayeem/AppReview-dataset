keeps stopping the game keeps stopping so i cannot play it. if this is fixed, it would be a really good game. it also hangs a lot amd is stuck on one screen. also i could not play the game after level 50
This game would force closed most of the time once you've reached level 55 or above. This has been happening on four different devices i.e. note 3, iphone 4, ipad 3 and lg g3 since I first downloaded it in 2013 and each time I've paid to have the ads removed under different accounts. My previous complaints and your responses via email to other accounts has come to naught. Don't you dev ever test it out Either fix the bug or consider refunding me on my purchases.
Crashes At level 50 i cannot play anymore becouse it says game has stopped working everytime i press play
Crashed Was great now won't let me play. Everything opens except solo play. Very annoying don't want to delete and loose all my levels
Jewish game This game is made by JEWS and its unnerving that the game frequently pauses to remind me to support Israel.
