A pretty good poker game, but it's possible to get to a state where you can't continue the game without making a realmoney purchase. That's obnoxious.
Upset I purchased wild cards and the payment went through over a week ago. The cards never updated in the game and the bank doesn't work. I can't seem to connect even over Wi fi. I sent an email and Ester responded, I sent through the transaction slips but never got any help.
What rubbish This game is far too glitch, keeps hanging or crashing especially as you progress and if you are winning. However winning is a rarity as the programming is so blatantly set to make you lose and have no option but to spend money and buy chips. Final gripe is that for a non Web based game it leads seems to crash when there is no Web access.
Lost Progress Which i had my old game back i was on fire.
Keeps losing my progress want my money back
Its too hard. You can lose a lot by folding, just waiting for any type of hand. It is very hard to progress through the game unless you pay real money. It also slows down and at times freezes. Often you may have a very good hand only to lose due the computer player having an almost impossible hand.
Crashes too much. Too many offers for other apps
