Something happened  Have had app for quite a while. SGS4, KitKat, worked well. Didn't mind the  app cost initially,  but since updating to Galaxy Note 4  and Lollipop, can no longer easily search for campsites, either by citystate OR nearby.  Absolutely will NOT find park for our needs continues to find only parks near to current location,  even though I followed directions  VERY frustrating.
Terrible since update I have had this app for a couple of years now and liked it until this last update. If it works at all, I look at a blank screen for at least 5 minutes before anything shows up. Then when I touch an icon absolutely nothing happens. Terrible app.
Poorly written I like the filters but the advanced filter section is poorly written. If I, say, display campgrounds, rest areas, low bridges and truck stops, and then want to limit the campgrounds to 4 stars and above, everything but 4star campgrounds disappears.  There's no way to see all the data I want and none that I don't want.
Can not switch to kilometers nexus 4 I can not pick kilometers. Stuck on miles.  Lots of outdated info. Found many sanidumps not in service any more. Updated 08Dec14. Now have a nexus 5 and still can not switch to kilometers.  The 3 dots at the bottom right do not do anything.
Most recent update kills it for me App no longer contains links to RV Park Reviews website when press on a  campground icon. Only links are to Allstays website same info as app and Trip Advisor whose campground reviews are not very good. I'm now sorry I paid  for this app.
Jo Batterson Location cannot be determined is what I get every time I try a location. I can move the map around but to no avail when I type in a location.
Crashed This app has crashed on me. Been making reports, but no help
