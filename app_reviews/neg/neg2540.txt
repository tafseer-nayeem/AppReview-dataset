It won't let me play. Every time I enter the game it flashes back to home screen after about thirty seconds. It does this with the stray cat SIM to. Please fix this I used to love this game and now I can't even take a step forward before it glitches and I'm sent back to home screen. Fix this and I'll rate five stars on this game and the cat one two.
Problematic Control Joystick control is erratic making it hard to catch pretty, fight, navigates. Other games use a click or swipe scheme much more effectively. There a lot of clipping issues going into rocks and the steep terrain screws up the camera angles. Prey animals aren't affected by water and can run underwater full speed but you can't. Just.overall.frustrating.
Waste of money So I get all exited because the pictures look amazing so I buy it... Everytime I try to go forward Im goin to the left then right and then im going backwards.... oh plus there weren't any creatures on the map... nice. im just saying but, THIS APP IS A PEICE OF CRAP AND A WASTE OF MONEY DONT GET IT. Oh plus the person who made this is lazy cuz there is litteraly a picture of a wolf when you run. And its super laggy. Wolf Online is better.
