DOC MCSTUFFINS I paid and installed it, i click on the game to put it on for my little one and the game never comes up. After like 3 seconds it goes back to mobile screen
Mcstuffin IT DOESNT WORK AT ALL AND I PAID FOR THIS FOR MY GRANDAUGHTER, WTF VERY DISAPPOINTED AND GIVE ME MY F IN MONEY BACK, Just take people's money
game force closes after 30 seconds. do not even have time to load waste of money for android zte valet.  Tried developers website.  No info on game for android users, only iphone users.
Great app if you hate your kid. Very little to it. Requires too much fine motor. Doesn't work well with Nexus 7 2012. My daughter hates it.
Ok but...... Its an ok app but its just a straight port from the iOS version. Doesn't even fill the screen It needs optimising for android. Come on Disney you can do better especially for a paid app. Poor effort in my opinion
Disappointed My daughter absolutely loves this game it worked no problems then it started having problems opening up..
Not great It looks cute but it's over priced considering the value there isn't much for them to do butyet takes up a lotof space.
Doc Mcstuffins Not exactly what I was looking for Game is not as interactive as expected.
Android Does not work. How do I get a refund
Doesn't run Freezes up on my Android device. I want a refund.
