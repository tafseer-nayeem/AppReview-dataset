Hate Well first of all I want to make two ponies and put it on there like I'm playing mlp and second of all there us no cutie marks u are crazy mlp can't be mlp without cutie marks Who ever made this is a female dog or the ones who made this are female dog's 
Its slooowww Probably because its big. Sometimes it just doesnt work. It might be my phone, i have a galaxy s4 note. Idk.
App restarts before I can save xnx Sometimes I'll exit out the app for a few minutes, only for it to appear blank and then restart my pony gone before I even got the chance to save it. Also, more manetails and cutie marks app based and uploaded from our files would be nice Even an option for more backgrounds again, from our files would be nice too.
Ugh It takes forever to load Fix it plz. I don't have time for it to load this flippng long.
