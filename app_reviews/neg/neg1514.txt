Tone of the voice is good but... I wish they would improve the pronunciation and emphasis to produce a question instead of a statement. It would make the reading of a story more enjoyable.
Won't Work any more with Google Maps Anything you can do to fix it working with Google Maps  I have the Samsung S5.  I saw the notes to disable google texttospeech then restart with CereProc but that doesn't work either.  Can you fix
Update broke Heather I loved this App, more than I dislike the default TTS in Android K.  Haven't L yet, waiting for stable 5.0.1.  Now, CereProc 3.1 no longer works, all I get is the shrill default TTS.  Upgraded to Android L.  Disabled Google TTS.  Still no Heather   Still doesn't work with maps and navigation as it had before most recent upgrade, even with Android 5.1 . . .
Was great when it worked  but no Google Navigation It's a great TTS, but it doesn't work on the single application for which I rely most heavily on TTS Google Maps Navigation. I've followed Cereproc's guidance disabling Google TTS, removing updates to Maps, starting navigation, then updating Maps to no avail. Would at least like an update on this issue. I didn't spend a lot of money on this app, but I did spend some...
Not working any more I liked this app, but it no longer works with Google Navigation, which was why I bought it. Support suggests disabling the Google TTS app and restarting. This has not fixed it. I still get the rather strident and bossy English voice, rather than the slightly melancholy Scottish one I paid for.
Screwed up after firmware update
Doesn't change Google now voice on my 4.2 galaxy nexus I expected that this would change the voice for Google on all of my android services including Google now. unfortunately it does not change the voice.
