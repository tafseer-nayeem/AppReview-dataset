Get your google wallet out Edited to a simpler review. Want to win races Spend real cash. Want to develop car for bigger tournaments Ditto. Want to keep playing, but avoid inevitable bankruptcy Ditto again So, yeah, just like real F1 Developer just how the hell are you supposed to continue in this game when it is impossible to a least break even with a half decent team setup You've had nearly a tenner off me, and no more. What a shame. Uninstall, and write off my money.
Save issues... Is a very good game but it never saves unless you sign in to google, so when I played offline and decided to sign in and sync, I was reset all the way back. Very stupid saving system costing me around 8... must be fixed I Want My Money Back
