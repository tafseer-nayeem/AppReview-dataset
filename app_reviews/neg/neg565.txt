Directions I'm just looking for an app that can successfully replace hopstop and provide me with train directions from one place to the next. This doesn't seem to be it
App is great but why does it always start in the background when I reboot my phone  I live in Europe and am in NYC only  3 times a year,  pls stop this unnecessary battery drain. The app version 2.9.3 still starts at reboot on my Note 3 running Android 5.
This app work good but I recently came across a problem.  I bought this app something like 2 or 3 months ago and I recently flashed new version of Android to my phone, after that the app told that I have to buy it again... Please help me solve this problem
