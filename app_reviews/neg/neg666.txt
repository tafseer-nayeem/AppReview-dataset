Game managers Gm has blocked me since ages and I am not able to send any feed back.... What if I want some kind of help in reset password something else What's the point of putting an option if I cannot even use it.
yawn its 2015 and we are still playing games with graphics from the 1980s same as any other useless mobile game built around empires and strategy warfare  absolute rubbish. avoid like the plague. didnt have it installed long enough to see if it was pay to win or not but it wouldnt surprise me.. got my tapjoy currency though so hooray for me
Bully Clans ruin the game...they tell people to kill themselves, call them F'ing retards....game does nothing about it. The game itself is ok, Which is almost exactly like the Hobbitt...kabam should sue them
Save your money Previously i had rated 5 stars but have changed due to recent game action and resposes. The game seems rigged for some players and alliances. The support from gm comes in biased responses with double standards for some players.
