I was trying to make a dubstep. And it doesn't record the music playing in the background for the remix I wanted to make.
Forever Loading Takes a long time for it to load. Whenever you do anything significant it takes several minutes to load.
Use this to move forward... The idea for the app is awesome but as far as this being anything like a music production app which was the intended idea, it's not even close. How about revamping to a new app where instead of button mashing ugly recordings of tiny loops, you give us actual dubstep production capability. Give us detail to create each wob and every snare hit and so forth. Give us the detail of an app creator who wants to succeed and not one who just wants to get by. And keep it free.
