Cant progress... no kitty moola I liked the game... and would have continued liking it and rated it 5stars... but im not going to pay so much money to buy the kitty moola.. its now becoming frustrating as I cannot prevent customers from getting angry and leaving the store. No matter how fast I play. This needs to be fixed.. as I am at the point of deleting the game. It is a serious problem that prevents you from progressing. So dont download.. it becomes dissapointing.
My cousin is upset No free hello kitty points in the start ahead only hired mimmy and the bear has two red circles in his face only that two cause no FREE HELLO KITTY POINTS
Refund my money I lost my coins which I purchased on 3rd July. My app got uninstalled by mistake. My coins are gone on re installing.. Plz Refund my money or give my the coins..
Bosan Boleh tak lain kali main game ne tk pyh nak beli pakai point..cuma pakai duit jer..tak enjoy lah main kalau macam ini.
My 3 year old daughter managed to spend 13.99 within minutes of being on the game. Please can I have a refund
