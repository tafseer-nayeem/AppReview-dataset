Problematic app while enjoying it. Why I keep on having this game which I passed but still on my tray The game hasn't even started but I cannot make a move. Please check. It is annoying to see it there for more than 150 days
Battery hog. Kill it if you're not playing This app eats up battery. It seems to be doing something in the background since it consumes a high percentage of my battery even if I'm not playing. Maybe loading up ads or excessive syncs with their server. You developers can do better than this
Ads Even though I refuse to buy the no ads version I should not have to deal with these push ads that pop up and reopen the app after I have closed the app if you want the ads to be waiting for the next time I open the app that's fine but when I'm trying to text someone and it opens the app just to show me a stupid ads that's not only stupid and wrong but it's illegal
The WwF Dictionary is Whack It's asinine that words like SI and QI and elements from the Periodic Table are allowed. In the good, old days, the words played had to appear in a real dictionary. FUD should not be accepted. I do like the graphics and sounds but the grating dictionary issue has finally made me angry enough to quit playing altogether. There could at least be a strict mode for us fuds.
Went from love it to why in the hell Great game Lots of fun. New update doesn't allow for old conversation to erase I counted on conversations deleted, fix it please And it's frustrating when I make the last move I know who wins No need to show me again who won and ask to rematch again and again
