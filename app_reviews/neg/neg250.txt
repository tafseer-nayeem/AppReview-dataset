Too good I'm losing my life to this. I would recommend it to my friends but they all left me and there is so one. I'm lonely because of this. At least the next set of features comes out in twenty minutes...
It's not funny anymore I remember when ifunny was actually funny that was like forever ago if ifunny gets funny again I will change my mind about the 1 star
Ifunny Where the living hell is my candy They asked if I wanted some and under my obligation, I accepted. Now where is it
I feel alot dumber with this in my phone. You can tell some guys that have been shut down by girls who don't want them or their outdated jokes run this app. All they feature is degrading jokes that immature 8th graders could've and probably did come up with. Do yourself a favor and don't even download it.
Used To Be A Fan... Alright, I know this is coming from a girl with a very stupid name but please let me tell you that hashtags on the searches are the worst idea ever. I want to be able to just name my work again instead of  hashtagging it. This isn't Twitter or Instagram. Just go back to the way things were before.
Rotate It wont let me rotate the screen yes my rotation is on and ive tried everything. It kinda sucks because my phone is broken so i needed the rotation to access my subscriptions which i liked alot. I dont know if its my phone but it seems to work on other apps.
Always buggy Kicks me out then try again it, says processing image error.
Seriously getting old For months now my Ifunny has been up to date but decides when it wants to and doesn't want to load gifs and vines. Makes it not worth having if I can't look at 23 of what is posted
