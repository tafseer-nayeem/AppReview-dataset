Slower and sllooowwweeeerrrr Been using this about a year but performance has degraded slowly over that time that it takes a couple of minutes to actually open the sheet and then when it does you can't actually change tab. Or if you can I don't have the patience to wait over FIVE minutes. Time to look for an alternative.
Needs to actually work Would be useful if it could pull up offline documents or any document
Confusing Can't figure out how to add data to the cells. The only way is to long press the cell for the keyboard to pop up but still can't add any data.
