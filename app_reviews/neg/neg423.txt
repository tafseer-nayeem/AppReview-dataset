Galaxy S4 TMobile NOT COMPATIBLE. this is only used to turn on and off mobile hotspot. Once it turns it on, it verifies account and will only use available hotspot then immediately disconnect. Its not for unlimited hotspot.
Worst While starting It doesn't check if the hotspot is already on or not. Also there should be a way to use default password stored in Android settings, rather forcing to select password here.
Don't waste you time It was a waste of time and money. It is compatible with my device but did not work as soon as I went to a different page it would turn off or just wouldn't even turn on a vast majority of the time. Plus I keep trying to get a refund and just get the run around crap wasting more of my time.
