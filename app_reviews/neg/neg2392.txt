Please help I loved this game. I had all the areas unlocked and I even spent 40 on real money to get cars and progress.  I need help getting my game restored. If I get m progress back I would rate it at 5
Awful It doesnt keep your money or the cars you purchased when you download onto a different device using the same google play account. On my tablet i had bought several cars and all four environments the city night snow ect. As soon as i downloaded it onto my cell I have to restart from the beginning with the free car.
