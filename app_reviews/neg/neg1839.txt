I loved the first game. Would love this one but it won't open. It just keeps crashing on everything we open it on. Please fix
Money grab I just bought the game and it won't even open Waste of basically 4
Won't even open Just purchased this and it won't even open. I reported  the problem and it wouldn't give me the refund option. So frustrating  It'll take your money and you get nothing in return.
Crashing Note 4 new update keeps crashing
Paid 3 can't even play the game says buy this game from market place. That's where I bought it. Tells me it's an unlicensed copy. Thanks guys Can't play and I paid for this. Isn't even a free game .
Freezes My daughter loves this game so we bought it and it freezes during play. We have to reset her nook hd. This needs to be fixed or we need to be refunded. She's very upset it won't work. Thanks.
Still Crashes on Tegra K1 Still Instantly force closes on Tegra K1. I love the Stickman Epic games. I'm sure this one's awesome, but I still can't play it.
Not worth it. It is a fun game and challenging but its just not worth it. It should be for free and if you really want money it should be 1 at the most. But its 3 and a ripoff. It's even not that fun after you complete the game there nothing. It's just a app that takes up space and swallowed your money. So I'm gonna say   Not worth it at all
Refund I had this game downloaded for a whole minute and it crashed, so I uninstalled and would like a refund
I don't want this game anymore I bought this game cause I though it would be magnificent to play But after a couple days, I got bored
