Love the app, but not worth the money I spent 7 on this, definitely a pricey app but I love the free version and I wanted budgets, but not worth it. This app keeps crashing so I can't even use it
Somewhat good app Simple very good app for keeping an eye on your spending but, expect ZERO support from developers if anything goes wrong. That's bad.
Newbie budget Thai would be great if I could snd to my network printer. STILL NO PRINT FUNCTION. NEED TO PRINT EACH MONTH, GRAPH  ENTRY'S
Please, add a possibility to set currency for every bank account and let users choose how to track them either one currency for all or in account currency. In case of restore from backup on new device user has to add a history of currency exchange again. And it's impossible if you use the app for quite long time.       ,      .             ,      .       .      ,        .
