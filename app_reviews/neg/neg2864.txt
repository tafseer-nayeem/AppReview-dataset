Wont work on S6 Stopped working once I upgraded to Galaxy S6. Uninstalled and reinstalled twice but still frozen. You've mentally scarred my child for life Just kidding, I wanted to be super over dramatic all the other online critics app still sucks though.
Too many inapp purchases
Garbage Hot, hot, hot garbage. And it's a trial version but even if it were the full version I'd ditch it.
Free then they charge 
Complete rubbish This is a very good app. .. on the iphone. On my galaxy s6 it is rubbish. Very slow and jerky. Seems to be very laggy. First time you use it...  it seems like its frozen..  or another screen breifly comes up. Means you have to go to manager and re select it.  Utter trash. Very dissatisfied
Frozen The app opens to main menu then freezes and wont allow the kids to actually play the activities.
Not enough In the free to tell if I like it to pay for it
Crashes everytime I try to open it, no updates....screaming toddler. Waste of my money 
IPad version is great. Android version is awful.
Boring I hate this game my cousine is three year old and if you want full version we have to pay for it I dont why all the people love this game
Geeta I love it
