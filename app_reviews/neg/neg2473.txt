Yaaas Really enjoying this, love the art style and the upgrade system is cute. Making me realise what an awful consumer I am with all these barcodes around me though haha. Had a couple or crashes on Samsung galaxy s5 but nothing major.  Edit  down to 2 star because it keeps asking me to rate when I have, and the camera has started crashing the game every time even after closing apps and restarting so I can't do quests. 'lt
Scam Made an in game purchase days ago. Money came out of my bank but nothing showed up in the game
I used to really enjoy this game but now it crashes every time I scan a barcode. It has been like that for a long time even though I have sent multiple crash reports.
Not worth it, save your money The game crashes early in and the in game mechanics feels clunky. Also on top of buying the game in the first place, there's additional in game purchases. Not worth the purchase at all.
I don't get it Not really a game. Don't like the multiplayer feature or the IAPs.
