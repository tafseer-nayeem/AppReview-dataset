Hero to Zero You took away the free text search feature Why Now I can't narrow my car search by looking for LWB or GTI only... Same with all other categories. I have look through ALL XBox types and not just XBox One WHY WHY WHY Please fix Pretty please with sugar on top
Complicated refine option The older refine option was much more user friendly. As much as progress is appreciated but some things are best left unchanged. To refine and narrow down a search is now very confusing and most times frustrating to a point where I simply log off.
Not posting adds. Since recent update I'm unable to post adds. Pop up reading enter at least one digit or letter. All fields filled in. Help I've removed and reinstall. Same issue.
