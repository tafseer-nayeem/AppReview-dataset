Absolutely useless unless you login, which would be fine if you could actually login.  Created an account on the website, verified email address, etc. and could not login on the app no matter what I did. I tried changing passwords, etc, etc. Useless useless useless.
Poor usability, poor free version The free version lacks really basic features such as saving a spot. And you can't even search locations. Very poor app
No even worth the trial This is a too limited version. Useless. This is a waste of time, can't even find  the spots usually crowded I know in the limited list provided by default. Avoid.
Wonderfull information for sailing
Great forecasts, terrible app
Pathetic
Used to be a 5 star apk in my smartfone But... in the latest update is messed them up Im used to work according to the weather conditions... forecast said to be ok in the past two days... sunny weather without any rain ect... but the weather was too rainy.. i trusted the latest update and the result was to get soaked... i have recomended this apk to a lot of people and with the new update forecast isnt correct... please fix that bad bug to reinstall your apk...
App doesn't work Downloaded on Sony Xperia z1 compact. No functions worked at all.
No overview, a shame payed WindGuru User Why not providing an overview of the favourite spots on the first state of the App The App should help me decide where to go.  An overview of predictions is given by the windguru websites, the windfinder app and the WindGURU11 app. One star, I deleted the app and installed the WindGURU11. But will continue to be a Payed Windguru fan
Stupid Very bad.. deleted immediately
