Use to be good Unusable on note 4 out of date timetables
Crashes when adding favorite routes I just downloaded it Samsung Galaxy S5 but the app crashes everytime I try to add a favorite route San Francisco transit.
Crashes all the time, doesn't like Internet toggle on off
Does not show connecting trains Does not show if I can travel to my destination by changing at an intermediate stop..instead it shows no journeys available..I assume it considers only direct trains..trips cannot be reversed
Meant to work for 2.3.3 up but hasn't updated on 2.3.6 for months package file is invalid, although it installed OK some time ago. I uninstalled and tried to reinstall but same problem.
Not happy. I've had this for a few months now, it's been great up until recently where I can't seem to track anything while connected to the internet. Its very frustrating.
Too many inaccuracies Tells me busses are coming but they don't show then one rocks up but it's not on the time table. Happens often enough to cause a burden. Hating adelaide metro services but have no other choice right now.
Fix you app morons Why do you idiots app developers promote a buggy app that used to work great, but currently won't allow me to enter my destination.  Seriously I'll change my rating when you fix your app, otherwise WTF am I supposed to do with you broken app that can't give me directions or bus times when I need it to that I paid for.
