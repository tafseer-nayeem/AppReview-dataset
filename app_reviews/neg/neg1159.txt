Please stop changing icons. First the original was better.  Second this one is hideous. Third your a brand, maintain your image don't reinvent every few days.   Seriously this icon is hideous. I honestly thought my phone got hacked and some malicious app was installed without my permission.
The app won't start I don't know which version introduce this problem, but every time I try to start the app it closed before it finish opening on my nexus 7 S
