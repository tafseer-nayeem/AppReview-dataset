Also took my money. No app to be found. Don't buy.
6 filters for 1.99 These add on packs are quite the ripoff...
Pack does NOT show up in my Aviary Photo Editor, and Aviary hasn't replied to my email requesting help. No damned instructions available, so I'd suggest caution if you're contemplating purchasing this pack.  Not good, Aviary.
No street at all I feel sorry for 1,99  I spent on this. Its not abut the refund but this pack is stupid. Like they never saw any street photography
Thief This app took my money and did not install the plugin I'm highly mad right now
Eh Li ke aviary as a whole... but these extra packages seem like scams.
