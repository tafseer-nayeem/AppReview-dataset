Very disappointed. I thought this would be a cool HPL puzzle game but it's just a BS random item generator that requires zero skill and just hope you get the right glyphs to solve the puzzle, which you almost never do. What a tremendous exercise in futility and frustration. Seriously, please, don't waste your money.
Meh I want to like this game I really do.  Unfortunately the mechanics of the game are ruined by the fact that no amount of skill or planning can offset the random glyph generator.  Impossible so far to win, and while I appreciate a challenge, I'd like to be able to rely on skill to achieve a win instead of cruel, cruel fate.
First FF game I didn't at least enjoy This is a beautifully producedwell made app. I also love the theme and felt it fit the game so I gave a star for each. Unfortunately, it fell very flat for me.  I think I would enjoy this more if the luck factor was toned down or was mitigated better.  I never felt like I won due to strategy more so than luck of the draw and dice.  Wish I could've gotten a refund.
