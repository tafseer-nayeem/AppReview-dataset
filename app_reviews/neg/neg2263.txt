Truly random This version of spider almost appears to deliberately not give you cards you desperately need... more times than not.  I play microsoft version and have great winning percentage. This version, no where close. Beginning to hate it. Cards dont seem so random sometimes. Seems to work against you rather than being random, but maybe microsoft version helps you and is the one not random
Tablet version doesn't work right
Every hand plays out the same. Did you shuffle the cards Crap
