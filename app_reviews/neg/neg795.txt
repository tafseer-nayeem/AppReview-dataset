New Update I loved this app and since they updated it I absolutely hate it I was able to paste a paragraph onto a picture without a problem and make corrections in the paragraph, change fonts, etc with simplicity... now everything is so complex. Why fix something that wasn't broken If you're going to add something do it without changing everything ugh
Crapdon't buy The app suddenly crashes and goes in load menu after all the editing The new update is of errors n the creators need to do something about this
Five star product Unable to paste words program stops need to be rectified
Reloading hopefully I haven't wasted my money.
I had to replace my phone and now I cannot download my propack, eventhough I paid for.
