Can't log in I downloaded this app and have not been able to log in at all. Every time I try, it says error retrieving info from server, please try again after some time. I have heard good things about this app and really wanted to leave a positive revier. Please fix this or tell me how I can fix it. I will update my review if I get it working.
Does not let you pay your credit card I've tried several times to pay my credit card on this app and it keeps saying invalid username and password.
Permissions,  or  control I like  the  freedom of  the app and  being  able to  shop from my phone.   But why  does this app need my  contact  information,  media  files,  microphone,  access to my  SD Card etc  I will be  considering  deleting this app because it requires to much  control.
Will not work Keeps blacking out my phone when I do anything but search for a product. Needs an update
