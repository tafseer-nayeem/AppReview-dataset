I recently purchased this app and it doesn't work Either fix it or refund my money please and I will find another app.
Was working good but now my state updated their  program to a different one and now this app does not work for me, I sent email to tech but no word back so I need a refund since I can't use app anymore. If you live in Illinois do not get, it is a waste of money.
No longer works.. It worked well till I got a letter in the mail saying they are switching cards. Got my new card in the mail. Activated created a new account. Then went to the app reset the credentials several times still will not work
Says user name or password invalid Please fix or refund my money. Want let me log in. Want even show my phase pic. I want my money back please I changed password three times now.
It won't let me login keeps saying user id an password wrong an it's not
Doesn't work for me at all I type in my user name and password and it says it's wrong I then do it from my laptop and it works
I am also having issues with the log in process.  Invalid password every time.
It shows me my balance but I can't see my statements.
Statements Would be nice to view my statement being that I did pay for this spp.
