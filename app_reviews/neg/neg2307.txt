VERY HARD I bought this thinking it would be like the original version. It is not It is very very hard  Most of them are rated very hard or hard. I thought it would be evenly distributed like the first version 5 easy, 5 normal, 5 hard, 5 very hard, for example. It is not If you are not extremely good at this game do not buy these versions. The only one that is similar to the original is the Christmas version. Do not waste your money
