Way to hard. Did t see any level setting. Would have kept it and more then likely paid the 4.99  for the premium but it's way to hard and you run out of life waaaay  to fast. I'm usually  good at these games. Think what you want but you desire yourselves know some of the those levels are way to crowded. Also the fact that some the hose hinges don't get triggered to a certain point means you die and die and die loose all that life for absolutely nothing. Maybe next time.
Pay to play game If you dont buy the game you cant get all levels and also all the time to play since this game lets you play like 3levels before your time is up
Goddamn Microtransactions If playing the game by how it was designed is what they want, then I guess having to pay for the damn game is its design. I mean seriously, who likes playing games you have to pay for Because of this, I'm not recommending this game to friends because they don't like paying for their games either
Worst game This is the worst game I have seen number of games since 3 years it always asking permissions and premium buy and always playing adds I hated it
