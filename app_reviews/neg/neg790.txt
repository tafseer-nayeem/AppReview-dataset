Deceptive I wanted to try out different hair colors other than the ones they provided, so I bought premium. I thought I'd be able to pick haircolors like at the salon with the different swatches, but instead they gave me a color grid to pick a custom color. It's OK, but very deceptive and not worth paying for
Disappointed The create your own color for burgundy reds and darker colors are washed out... should have just used the free one
Not worth paying for. I tried the free version but decided to pay the 1.99 to upgrade. It's totally not worth it. The app does work really well, but it doesn't give you many more hair color choices than the free version. Its just a base hair color also. No highlights or lowlights. I'm disappointed.
Waste of money if you have dark hair and want to try lighter colors.
Not happy just purchased And it won't change the colour of my hair keeps kicking me out when I change the colour
Wont work
Waste of money Totally waste of money .. worth nothing ..
Awful I bought the premium thinking it would be better. This app just sucks. The color choices are awful, the custom color is difficult. There is no highlighting. What a waste
It's a start but.... Honestly if you can give a rich black color to hair then you have no right to charge for basic photoshop features...
It doesn't look real so don't waste your time and spend your money on the full version
I paid This should not cost money. Not worth it
It looks aweful Very poor graphic
Awful I wish I could get a refund, I hate this app
