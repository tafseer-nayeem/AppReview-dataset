Paid for but says I didnt My bank account shows I paid for the full version,  but when my kid plays this game it says to get full version.  Please refund my money this is so stupid
Too many pop up ads. When you advertise free then it should be full versions and NOT SAMPLES
Rip off The game description said it was FREE. A four very minor games are free. They just repeat unless you BUY the full version
Ekk Not much to do for free lots of pop ups for the kids to click on 
In app purchases Was OK, not great and then you have to make a purchase for the full game... Frustratingly in the free app section on app store
Won't even open Loading Loading Loading.. great game... NOT
Bakwas h ek dam... Don't download. ...nothing is there for kids
Any advice I need help how do u download the up cz am trying n its not downloading
