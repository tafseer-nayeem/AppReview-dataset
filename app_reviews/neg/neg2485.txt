Fun.. paid for game, now can't play after update The game was really fun and enjoyable.. I decided to buy a few things,  and the monthly VIP and now the game hasn't been really working in 2.5 days. I feel like I wasted my money, what the heck
Can't play the game Can't connect to any of the servers and I can't choose another server to try to play. It looks like a great game but what's the point when I can't play the game I just downloaded
Wtf Loved the game, but now that it's been down all day, when I log on I gotta start over from scratch
Great game Ok. I edited this multiple times. I'm debating if I want to stop playing. Please just refund the diamonds I accidently spent on the skull in shop and I'll put to 5 stars. Huge inconvenience a whole day basically gone.
Tired of server issues Good game but full of bugsserver issueslost gemsexp. Also it has a terrible plunder system
Great game if you have the money to play. Dimond and gold hard to come by. Everything cost Dimonds. Finally  tired of it taking three weeks to upgrade gear. Thanks gosu uninstalling. Better luck with next game
