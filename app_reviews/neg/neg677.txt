I play  this game at school If you want me to send it over the years and have a great weekend too late
Not free Played the game first to see if I would have any problems. Well I did. Why do I need to pay 35 up front for the whole year Why should I  What makes this application different from the rest
really I expected more from this app, since it is no better than many actually free learning appsservices . Gets old fast just like the others and there is nothing unique. At least the makers understand this and get their money first , with the yearly subscription only options.
Talking library Give us backpack bear or I'm never doing starfall again
Keeps crashing my tablet  Not exact sure what happened but our 4 yo LOVED IT suddenly it has begun to crash my Samsung 10.1... such a shame because she would ask to play the program... it crashes and restarts the tablet upon opening. We have uninstalled  several times but always the same thing
Not good When you get on you don't even have all the things
Please fix Not working on all of our tablets or phones. We have strong WiFi and keeps saying not connected to Internet. It was great for my kids when it was working.
