Totally not even worth the dollar You can get better games for free Disappointed.
Wont run on my tabet Just bought this and it wont run. Just tells me its stopped running when I click on it. Needs to be fixed
Doesn't work Crashes on startup, has never run on my tablet.  Waste of money and frustrated child  Update this app does not work for secondary users. Need to buy a second tablet to keep little fingers out of my emails 
Paid for it and says that it is installing and that is as far as it goes. Very uphappy 3 year old.
Not worth the 1.09 The girls hated it and the game itself was crap and was a total waste of money.
Not installing After download nothing happens, no install
It keeps stalling, shutting phone down to get it going
It does not even get installed on th we tablet  not rateable
Sound not working.  How can this be fixed
Worst paid apps Bring back my money
Rubbish Wouldn't download or refund
