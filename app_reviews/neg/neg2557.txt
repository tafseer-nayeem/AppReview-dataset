Doesn't connect from Crimea Seems like the Sweeds are butthurt that now Crimea is Russian. But deep in my soul I still hope it's just a technical glitch and the Sweeds are cool. Dear developers, please respond to this comment, I'd be grateful if you at least explain what this is. Yes, my internet is good, everything else I use works as it should.
Critical bug Sometimes the game throws different questions to the opponents, so it doesn't make sense to compete anymore. I paid money for full version and now regret it. Devs aren't doing anything about it I want a refund
WTF Ain't downloading.
Can't connect Can't connect,  until I clear app data, then in one or two days, again can't connect.
