Can't decorate objects Didn't try all sections of the game, but found that we were unable to color the pottery and pinwheel. The objects just turned black and remained that color. Will request refund. Have several other Dr. Panda games that are great and work flawlessly, but can't say the same for Art Class.
Just bought this but will ask for money back, game will not orient to landscape modeJust bought this, will get money back, game will not orient to landscape mode. Have loved all the other Dr. Pandas for my 3 year old grandson   
Super fun but... Did you know that they can use your mic and hear you Creepy.  Though fun, its not worth your safety. Without that fact, I would give this two 5 star ratings.
Money back I want my money back
Boring You all ways do the exact samething over and over again. I wish I could refund it but I cant.not worth it
It says I paid for it but it won't let me play and it won't install and I paid for it 
I want a Refund
