Freezes Up. Don't Buy Wasted my money.  Widget freezes up, won't work. App works great.
Widget Bought the widget, and it never loaded up on my phone. Then I uninstalled the widget, and waited a few days reloaded agn, and it still doesn't load. The app works fine. Please fix the widget.
Very upset, DON'T BUY I am very upset, I purchased the widget and it will not work, The app works but the widget DOES NOT work, Would love to have used it, Disappointed 
WON'T REINSTALL AFTER PURCHASED DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APP I went to reinstall and it has no open.
Angry Will not refund and uninstall
Huh How do you use this, I checked my widgets and it won't appear, look man, I paid money for this and it won't do anything. At least tell me HOW to use it. Does it like link to the other list app. FYI the instructions on how to use this should already be in the description.  wish refund was possible by now.
Will not open not authorized tells to repurchase
Say it is not licence Does not work
Disappointing Does not work on galaxy note at all. Can not do anything. No response
Great App but has a huge flaw. I just purchased this widget only to realize i can't use it because it is too large. I could not see where to adjust size to fit my screen. If this was changed i would repurchase the widget again. So i will just use the app. 
Just like the app just huge... No thanks
