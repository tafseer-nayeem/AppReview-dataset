Spyware Seriously 1.23MB Size for just a flashlight  Ty for making people install Spyware without knowing. Google this you will see its true that's why they settled lawsuit with FTC.
Stupid people This is STUPID what are we supposed to do with it i thought it will let u text with it it doesn't do anything really i mean what I AM ROYAL SO THOSE PEOPLE BETTER GET THIS BETTER NOW
This app sucks. Every time I try to turn it off, it stays on, so I have to power off my phone.
Useless Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. Useless, since this kind of app MUST work always, as fast as possible, when you need a flashlight you don't have time to fiddle with stupid options and screens full of ads trying to make it work.
Too many ads Plz spare me from these unwanted ads. A slight touch on the screen and some unwanted site gets opened...this is extremely disturbing. Also recently the app started malfunctioning. Flash light  automatically gets switched on and off at times, I have checked phone settings and there is no issue with phone rather its a bug in the app.
