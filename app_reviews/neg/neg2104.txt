Worst game ever...... It is the worst game I have ever played in my life ..starting levels are easy but as you move in...you cannot play without the help of a video....jst disgusting
Got stuck and unable to move forward If I have watch video after video to move forward the clues your giving aren't clear enough for your basic human...don't bother unless you feel like being frustrated on every level
Does not work. Items collected disappear and even after cracking the first code nothing happens.  When Walk through opened it only contains adds for other games. Waste of time
Too  Hard I am new to these types of games but I am so frustrated by this one. It's no fun if you have to watch a video for a hint on nearly every level I had to uninstall it, it just made me feel stupid and angry.  Next time could you make it just a BIT more intuitive
