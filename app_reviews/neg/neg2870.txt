Good but.. Good concept but the don't know if it's worth spending 3.00. The one thing I really like about this app is that you can save what you're working on, and come back to it any time. My biggest problem with this app is that only 1character can delete blocks. I think we if I come across another problem I might uninstall it
BORING First I liked it then I gradually HATED IT. I WANT A REFUND THIS COSTED MY DAD'S MONEY.
Boring Its very confusing and I think it is trying to be like Mine craft but its not. You can only build cubes and blocks because there is no furniture to make a house with. Little children may enjoy it though.
Does NOT work under childrestricted user account On my Nexus 7, I have a restricted account for my kids. Toca Builder says it can't validate with server and just dies under the child account but works under the main account.  This is a problem.
Will not install Won't work or open on tablet or  Android. Would like a refund.
