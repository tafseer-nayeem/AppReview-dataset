Bugs in application The new unread message count shows on app and in chat section even after reading the messages which is irritating as i keep on checking if i got any new response for ads. Also i will be happy with old app facility which used to show out of advertisements that you viewed and that used to give idea of remaining ads pending to see and used to save time and decide if i really wanna go till end to see them. Please fix the bugs and bring the old facility again.
