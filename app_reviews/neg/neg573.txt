Everything looks cool but, DO NOT GET THIS APP. I really liked it until I locked my phone and it wouldn't turn back on. I have to take the battery out and put it back in my phone just to turn it on. I deleted the app and the bugs in my phone still won't go away This app is trash
Remove Hola Family icons... Why the hell is Hola Family icons nonremovable I don't want to install them, wasting space in drawer... Uninstalling...HOLA LAUNCHER.
Uninstalling..... I actually liked this launcher until i got pissed off of these ads that just keeps on appearing random times, and theres no way to remove it because theres no way to purchase premium version.. Uninstalling this because of those ads
