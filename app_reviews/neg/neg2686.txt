Accuracy I like playing this game, but on my mobile it does not count even half the words I play. Very annoying. The last word accuracy in the tournament is appalling. Since 5 months I did not get any experience points and I play EVERY day  On top of all that I do not get anymore ink since 5 months either. Maybe the two stars I gave you are too many for the quality of your game.
Log in issues It keeps trying to log in with a strange username and when I click no, it won't let me log in at all. I signed up and played a few times when first downloaded and it was a fun game. Now it won't let me log back in so I can't play.
NOTIFICATIONS NOT WORKING. Can someone in IT fix this issue. My word, I contacted support approx. 2 weeks agoto no avail. I'm really surprised  the lack of responsesolution. If I could, please believe, this would be 15 of A star Also, I've had my phone checked, it's determined to be the application.
Bugs Hate the fact it made me rate it because pop up wouldn't go away until I accepted. Also my tiles don't airways connect on the first try causing me to lose time.  I've had to try as many as 8 times to make a single word.  Guess that's my OCD costing me.  This game used to be good.
Did not work Download would not open past the ruzzle main page. Smh. I would have loved to play this game. Even after deleting and reinstalling, it still did not work. Will be deleting permanently
... Usually 5 stars but 1 star for now as I cannot connect to Ruzzle with my WiFi for the last week.  Have heard it's Sky but the rest of my family have no problem at all. I don't like having to switch to mobile data because I keep forgetting to change back. I tried reinstalling but all that did was lose me hard earned 303 coins 627 ink points Very annoying
