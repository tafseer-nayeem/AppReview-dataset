Crazy level zulu station we may not win at the level zulu station ... this game is ridiculous when I've upgraded weapons. I think you should ignore this game
Advancement It becomes difficult to the point you are forced to buy in order to move forward in the game. I am still waiting for the stuff I purchased...the towers are only able to be upgraded twice so far...it's losing the fun value after a few days of play.  I love playing Jurassic World. The best part is its just difficult enough to actually get ahead with out having to pay, if you strategies correctly.  I will rate higher when I receive what I payed for.
Graphic Issues Turret sites black out from time to time and have no graphic. Need to close the game and or reset tablet it to fix. Bug where my upgrade timers will suddenly jump to 6 days.
Where is everything I literally just downloaded the game and the first thing I've noticed is it will freeze on me. Second thing, going through the tutorial and I can't seem to see the playing board, nor the enemies. Its black as well as the enemy sprites. Please can you fix this I'd really like to give a good review.
Great till the last two updates. Couldn't play after two ago thought maybe new one would fix it but didnt. Really like the game wish i could play it
Great game but crashes crashes way too much and there is no end to the game. you just beat the last level and nothing happens. Needs more levels. Still a great TD game
