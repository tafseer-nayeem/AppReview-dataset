Lag Volume theme which is my favorite theme makes phone lag like crazy. On a brand new LG v10 so this should not be an issue. Very disappointed as it is really a gorgeous lwp
Good but battery sucking
Launcher problems I was having major problems with my launcher reloading the screen when I would close an app, I switched this app wallpaper and I have no problems. Ps I tried many launchers and this app causes the same problem.
Note 4 crash issue This wallpaper was perfect until the last update. It crashes my phone. Fingerprint scanner doesn't work properly. Phone resets. After I switch to another wallpaper phone was fine. Please fix this.
Crash on Startup I bought this app, and it never started  I can go to the settings, but when i try to activate it crashes. Would be nice if you take a look support.
