 I downloaded this game and it plays through the little video at the beginning then shuts off. I tried restarting my phone I have deleted the game and re installed  it and it keeps doing the same thing
Cheated Dear app creators, I have been cheated of two ponies from events, all because your system said I was rank 37 when I indeed had more points then the person in lead. You best be fixing that, and giving me the pony I had earned. Until then, your app will not receive my money.
Great game This is a great game I love how to can build your own ponyville and do quests and play games but recently I got a new device and I downloaded this game again but now it always freezes when I try to get on it. It freezes before it loads I have not even gotten to play it yet on my new device. Please fix this
Does not work When I played the minecart game and I won DJ pon3 but I never received the pony plz fix this issue and I will give 5 stars
Try fixing the major bugs now Can't even launch it, and if I do it crashes and deletes my progress. Can I have one update that doesn't come like friggen Swiss cheese, there's way too many holes in your programing. Quit worrying about hackers trying to cheat, it's not going to make them buy your stupid gem packs. Fix the actual issues that are wrong with the game
Fix the bloody bugs Ever since the new update the game has kept crashing when i try to move the camera or even crashes when i am starting it up. I liked the game but now it is just ridiculous and not going to give you 5 stars til you fix this MAJOR bug
