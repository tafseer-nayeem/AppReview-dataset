absolute crap. first game I have ever paid for and the worst pay outs ever.
Closes down Please refund as it freezes and then closes the game down
Not happy I used to have this on my iPhone  first thing I noticed was the music changed.loved the old music but most importantly, it took 102 spins before I got free spins 20  out of that I got measly 3500 and I am playing the dream setting
Hearts Very poor now. Unlucky game to play for virtual cash.
Have it on dream winnings, I have to spin 50 times before I get a bonus feature. I spun 290X before I won more than 30 in a bonus round.
won't download. droid x.
it crashes a lot. grumpy that i paid money for this 
This game is a money taker might only be a couple of dollars for 1 person. How many people will lose their money Money grabber time waster Poo
