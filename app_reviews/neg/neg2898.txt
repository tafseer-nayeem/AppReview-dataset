A Google User My kid loves the app but it will not install on his tablet Galaxy Tab 4 8.0
Incompatable with 4.3 Got a new phone and I can't reinstall the App. My little girl LOVED this app and it's a shame I have to give it a bad review because it hasn't been kept up to date. Hopefully the dev will actually get this working with newish phones. Galaxy S4, and yes the GS5 is out now.
More Bloated Than That Elephant Icon The app itself is pretty basic the singer's not perfect but it's fine. However, this app takes up a whopping 15MB of phone memory and cannot be moved to the SD card. For a basic music app that's unacceptable. Unless you have tons of phone storage STAY AWAY.
Didn't install after purchase. Don't bother. If I dont get the refund like others then I WILL be making official complaints
I never purchased this horrible app but somehow I was charged for it. I better get a refund
This is the cheesiest app even for toddlers. Sounds like a guy in his garage recording on his phone playing his guitar.
This is the dumbest app i ever purchased..never even worked at all.

Did not install correctly, then no refund. Don't bother with it.
