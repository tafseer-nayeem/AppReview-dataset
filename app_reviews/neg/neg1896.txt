WORST APP ON EARTH Noticed a 6.78MB update this morning. Still no 15 minute weather update interval. I've permanently moved on with this app. Even if 15 minute weather update interval is put back on the app i'm still boycotting it. I use Weather Services Pro now it updates ever 5 minutes.
Sucks Now there is only one widget. Ugh.
Now have Nexus 6p. Will give 5 stars again if you give us different weather providers like AccuWeather. Bought this app sometime ago, was a great app. Loved it  Update giving it another try. Will see if the bugs have been fixed if so will give 5 stars again.NOPE STILL SUCKS Very disappointed.
Why am I still seeing ads I bought this app and was expecting ad free application, but instead, I'm still seeing ads. This is a breach of contract. I hope Google takes note of this, since it is the one collecting payments for this guys.
