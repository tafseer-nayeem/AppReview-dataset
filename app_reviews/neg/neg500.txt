NEEDS IMPROVEMENT The app keeps coming on can't shut it off, also crashes my phone ANDROID when I try to stop it. Not worth the money free apps are better than this. Had this app for three weeks and used it from morning to night every day. And did not impress me
Cannot close it Had to download the free version, which works perfectly. The paid one forces me to go into settings and force stop the app in order to exit it. Silly, really silly.
Latest 2 updates messed the audio Most of the time it does not release audio focus in bluetooth mode once the alert is finished using the phone call stream, not the music stream. Please fix that. It was working before the last 2 updates
Speed warnings all wrong sign said 60 the program beeps 50
Also signaling cameras in wrong direction Although it is a paid app, the open database provided is unable to detect  travel and speedtrap direction and therefore app sounds alarm all the time. Which sort of beats the purpose.
Was the best, now it's crap Older versions were nice, but newer one is a crap. Fullscreen radar alerts have gone,only voice alerts are available if you use other gps nav app. The alert service stay active even you use the Exit option. After years using it, I had to uninstall it.
NEED NEW CAMERA UPDATE 1000 of new camera added in GCC.  PLS UPDATE.  Pls.check trapster for new cameras
Crashes and I am not disable alert
