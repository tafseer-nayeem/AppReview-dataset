DO NOT BUY THIS. It's been abandoned for months and it got very buggy. The developer promised an update a long time ago but for now there's nothing on the horizon. Used to be the best feed reader, now it's a mess.
Buggy News has not been updated since January now. The dev is obviously just supporting gReater.
Refund please Tried to contact you in different ways about bugs and issues.  No reaction what so ever.  I want refund. reporting this app right now.
Pleaaasssee add feature When im on my feeds list, it does not fill the screen totally, I see the article list on right side of screen all the Time. There is setting in look and feel settings in gReader callled hide article list pane, why not add this to news app.
Used to be great.. but recently everything has gone haywire and dev hasn't been responding to complaint. Pls consider fixing it
Bugs with no support No update in well over a year and more than a few bugs
Crashes on Click Through The interface is fine but the app crashes frequently when clicking through on articles. Not acceptable for such an expensive app.
A few bugs, no new development There's a lot to like about this app, but there are few glaring bugs and development seems to have stopped. If development was active, I'd give it 4 stars. But I can't recommend buying a dead app.
Zero I don't know wtf you did but almost every article I read now pops open an unsolicited app in the app store, and I have the paid version.
Problems with all extensions Doesn't work with ttrss at all
