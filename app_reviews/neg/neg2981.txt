Stopped working
App won't work App won't work after having it for approx 2 weeks.
Too repetitive Although my kids enjoy this game, it's very repetitive, has only one level, and all data ie. stickers earnt are lost each time you exit the app or hit the home button.
Monkey preschool lunchbox Will not open due to hardware specs but is working for other users with Toshiba at100
Unhappy I purchased 3 of the Monkey Preschool games tonight for my son who loves the apps.... However they will not download to my Galaxy, I keep getting an error 491 message. Very unhappy at the waste of money and now I have a very upset 2 year old
