Complicated And Poorly Made This App Sucks, 1. The Game Crashes In A Server Every 5 Seconds. 2. No Controls, Which Give You Your Disadvantage When Playing With Xbox 1 Users And PCMac Players
Bah It sucks a lot that you have to buy robux or more.it costs 99 to buy JUST A STUPID DUMB THING FOR A GAME.I wasted 400 from my father.Its outrageous you guys want people to Buy This Buy That what stupid crap.Nothing happens but,my chat goes away for a hour and it glitches me straight out my favorite game I HATE HATE HATE IT RIGHT NOW FIX IT NOW NOW NOOOW if you fix these problems I'll give you 5 stars.
WISH THAT I CAN RATE 0 STARS OR 0 YOU GUYS ARE TESTING MY PATIENCE I PLAYED SLENDER AND THE AD VIDEOS KEPT POPPING OUTAND SOME MORE,I PLAYED BLOODY MARY AND IT WAS STUCKHOW THE F WAS THIS HAPPENING
Doesn't work When I play a game it will freeze and I will have to restart the game
SO LAGGY It never lets me play and when it does it gets pitch black. I suggest you just play it in the computer because it is terrible in the New mobile version 
Grrr I got it but i cant move so i die staight away please fix i wil rat 5 stars
IT DOESN'T WORK Every time I try to get into a game it just shows the skyAnd when it works it doesn't load any thing then logs me out of my account
