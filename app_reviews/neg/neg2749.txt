Hated it I hated it because it only got 2 games on it I will only put 5 stars if they unlocked it but I love it it's almost my favorite game but why all the games like this game have 2 or 3 games
Best game ever It's a great game BUT there are three things only that are unlocked and they are hot dogs hair salon and villa decoration and every thing else is with money stop being rapacity And for your information i am a girl in fifth primary
Sucks Because they want us to by ever thing that's not fair I hate it never playing this again
