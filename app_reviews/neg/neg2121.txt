Kept kicking me off After level two all it kept doing was kicking me off didn't even load all the way.
Bad update Again The kinks went away and now they are back I can't even get into the game... I liked the game. But after the last update, I can't get into the game, literally. It starts to load and then kicks me out. Doesn't matter if I start it from this screen or the app shortcut.
Toy blast I love this game but when I get to the second board the app shuts off so I have to uninstall it
Pay to play This game was fun, till I got to where you have to by powerups to play. Uninstalling
