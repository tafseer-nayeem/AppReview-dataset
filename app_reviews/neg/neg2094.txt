best yerh..my cousin iwan mabanaba like it...hahahaha
Not really what I was expecting  My daughter  wanted this game for a bit of entertainment  so I installed  it  BIG  MISTAKE she always  loses against  Android  and when she goes off it and puts it  back  on the game automatically saves  she doesn't  really  like it .plus android  has 2 ways to escape  so no point
