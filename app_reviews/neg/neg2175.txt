Bakwas hated it Same movements on every song only song I changed show some more steps otherwise its flop app
Crashing I just installed the game and can't even open it. The moment I click on it, I get a crash report screen. Uninstalling it.
What a dump game. It is a dumpest game in my tablet
I just started the game  then cursed report had been come
Esess se bakvas game apni puri life mai nahi dekhe
It is shame that it crashes .. I hope you can fix the problem
Useless. What the hell actually,this game doesn't have any kind of concept just a waste
Recording and hang There should be recording of the dance and it gets hang often
It is doodi game Very bad
Type o fnice
Rajdeep Das In this you can't tap the buttons to dance. They will dance and you have to tap them to increase your score. This game can hang. This game is fit for little kids.
It wasnt as good as I hoped All you have to do is tap a circle and I was hoping to dance to it
Hated I hated it . it is worst. I thought that it is very good but it was worst.
No dance associated It could have been any random background. No relation to dance at all. 2 star only for the thought
Piece of crap Pointless random taps and swipes just to gain points. Characters will just keep dancing regardless of ur taps and swipes. Why did you waste the time in 3d dancing animation U cud hv jst kept a video behind ur useless taps and swipes..Stop abusing game technology and mobile platform by releasing such nonsense apps
Good thought but...... I like the idea but it is just a pre programmed animation. And you can't even enjoy dance since you are busy touching dots here and there.....atleast make a replay to see how you performed
