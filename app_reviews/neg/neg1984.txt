Would rate 5 stars but... I've been playing this game for a long time ON TABLET and I loved it. Now that I have it on my phone, it doesn't seem right. It feels like it lags behind and the audio sounds weird...
Kinda not Because why doesn't full version cost FREE Only on full you can create your own levels
HAHAHA HAAAAAAA.. UUUUUHHHHHH..OOOOOHHHHH..... ads........ they cause the game to crash and it pauses my music witch actually helps me better than using the music provided by the game so SERIOUSLY THE ADDSS ARE SO ANOYING AFTER ALMOST EVERY OTHER DEATH I HAVE TO RELOAD THE GAME BECAUSE OF THEM.......... O  so please fix this problem and 5 stars.
