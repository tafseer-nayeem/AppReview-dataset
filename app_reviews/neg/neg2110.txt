Samsung 5 Very disappointed in the Championship Arena this week. I have been trying to win above the top 20 level without using additional money. I have played and played. Finally I only used 2 moves to complete the level17,000 pts with 23 plays left to earn points. Ha wouldn't you know, the total points came to only 22,000. Barely in the top 20 That should have placed me in the top 10. I love this game but that shows me it isn't fair. Disappointing
Was fun. Update ruined the app Was a fun game. Update made the app completely stop working. Will not even open. Was on level 596 so I'm upset I'll have to uninstall
