Bug at first launch It was a great app until I can not launch it because of the resources not found when trying to download the assets 
Want the old version back. Don't like the latest upgrade.  No video.  Keeps stopping.  Really messing up my workout.
Uninstalling I'm uninstalling this app because no matter what I do it sends me notifications every 530 SECONDS. Do you have any idea just how irritating that is Not only is the sound annoying but it's killing my battery. I can get the same info from this app from Google with a lot less irritations.
