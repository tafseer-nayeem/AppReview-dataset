App crash This app continues to crash midlevel on 72. I haven't had problems up until now. Will update when fixed 
Final six timed levels suck all joy   away The early levels great fun, the final six suck all joy away from game and turn it for challenge to work. I  play games to escape work.
Loved it Update ruined it. I despise freemium games. I understand devs need to make money so why not just offer a paid version I would happily pay 510 for a full version.
