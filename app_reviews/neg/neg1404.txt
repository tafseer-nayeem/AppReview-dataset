Camera issues on Nexus 6 Constantly refocuses after a crisp image was achieved before hitting the camera button to take the image.  Takes two to four attempts to get lucky and get a crisp image on Nexus 6, would be faster to simply enter the contact info manually.  Very disappointed, hope this gets fixed asap.
Bad focus on nexus 6 Camera doesn't focus on the nexus six making the app useless.  Worked well on my last phone
