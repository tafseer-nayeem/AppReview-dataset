OK speedometer, but terrible config UI I was unable to configure the speed overlays, even after reading the help PDF. Quite frustrating.

Cannot find any reliable gps I live in India and this app cannot find any reliable GPS near me ever. Strange... If this app is country specific then it must be mentioned.
Purchased pro and got refund Does not correctly work in overlay mode with google map.
Not work Waiting for reliable gps signal but i have active gps and mobile data my gps is not problem...
Used to be good Used to be a very good little app for measuring speed and elevation, now it's a big overgrown annoying thing that wants to be a weather app and navigation as well. It consumes large amounts of energy even in the background when it should be turned off and you can't disable its constant location update.
