Are you kidding guys Giving it as free download to purchase later And the trial is for just 10 mins Holy crap, that's BS
Hmm... I love your weather app but I've always wanted this widget. But free apo but then it costs money in the app I don't like that. But I will buy this later on.
Well okay... it's free to download but you pay to use it. But a 5 minute trial time Come on now... there are plenty of free skins available. Don't waste time purchasing this.
Doesn't work Tried to use it but it keeps stopping
Wow It's amazing for me when this app only recognizes Glendale AZ and I live in Phx AZ, what was someone not paying attention..
This app does not work, i need my money refunded. Terrible
Galaxy s5 Simply,a waste of time...
Not worth it All the good widgets are not free
Very bad i Can download it free but it's the trial version
Trick you Free download but you must purchase source for it to work.
Fake Don't bother downloading, it sends you to another download

How to uninstall it
Rip off
5 minute trial Set the widget, looked at the home screen, pressed the settings hotspot, looked through settings, closed settings, trial expired. Really Uninstalled. I'm not a one star kind of guy, but that's a pretty bad trial period.
Does not work See title
Don't waist your time It is very bad app.
Bad bad It is not a good quality apps
