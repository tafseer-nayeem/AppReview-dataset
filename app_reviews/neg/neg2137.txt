Nice game shame about the over the top adverts Why oh why are developers so greedy, one advert in five games i could stomach, but before every game just means I'm going to uninstall. So the developer loses because of their avaricious tendency,  why don't I feel sorry for them 
Ads complaint again Honestly I don't mind the ads. What I do mind is the COMMERCIALS that stop my book playing  then I have to exit the game, restart my book, and go back to playing. Could we just have ADS and not these interrupting commercials
Adverts are annoying and won't shift The best card game out there for me but spoilt badly by the ads that arent removable and you have to wait for them to go....... Still bad for adverts and dont ask us to email in ,im sure we just want to chill out and play your game , not start emailing greedy game developers.....I would gladly pay for an ad free version...... Consider yourselves uninstalled
Crashes Update game is still unplayable. I'm uninstalling. I really thought I could hold out for an update but it's been months and no fix in sight. In fact, no acknowledgment of my issues. Thanks for nothing. Game is currently unplayable on my Moto X. After 20 seconds or so, the game crashes.
Beware of Adware It would be a great app if it didn't come with adware. Can't stand getting pop ups on my phone
The ads spoil it The game itself is nicely implemented, but  long and loud fullscreen video ads popping up frequently spoil it. A small silent easily closed ad, OK, but this is a simple game, not worth getting blasted with ads. Why not offer a paid, adfree version for those of us who don't enjoy being barraged with annoying ads
