Quality I read some reviews and decided to give this a shot. In the end I'm pretty unhappy I paid 1.99 for the app, I had to reset my device because the download has been sending me duplicate messages that I can't respond back to. It had a large lag time. I deleted it already off my phone because I don't think it's quite useful. I'm sorry but it's not as I had expected.
Doesn't work I have tried to open this on the watch and it won't connect. I've tried changing the display to horizontal like some suggest. Everything else connects fine, just not this app. It's crap. Can i get a refund
It is not responding to my phone out of 10 times only once will work
Not satisfied I just made the down load. And staring to under Stan how it work and the gear just capt  teling  devise disconnected and then it conecting  and disconnecting. I was in a call and it just made me mad because I could not stay in the call.
Dont bother I paid 2.99 for this stupid app and it wont even send messages.....
Doesn't work Getting a message that there is not enough space on the device... Yet this is the first thing I have put on it.
Won't open Won't load my messages. I keep getting the error message that my mobile phone  won't sync
No notifications Doesn't notify you when you receive a new txt. I get email and ph call alerts on my Fit  but absolutely nothing for txt messages. Absolutely useless. Wasted money.
I need a refund I have the Note Edge and this app is the only one for my gear fit that is almost always unresponsive, says my Gear isn't connected to my phone when I'm receiving messages on it just fine. It's horrible I need my money back.
Difficult setting it up I have everything downloaded but can not figure out how to get it to work on my gear fit to send messages. Everything on my gear fit is exactly as it was on factory settings after downloading. How do I get it to b able to type messages n not just send quick texts.
Upset Not allowing me to open message
