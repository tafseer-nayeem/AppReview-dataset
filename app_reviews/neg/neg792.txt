FIx Video Recording Sucks This app is a great partner for taking pictures. I'm looking forward for the fix of video recording to make this app as my all in one buddy. Too slow for frames of video.
Problem Focussing On my Alcatel One Touch IdolX, the app just doesn't seem to focus when required. I've often ditched the app for my default camera app to get photos, after tens of focus attempts. The filters are creative so plus points for that.
