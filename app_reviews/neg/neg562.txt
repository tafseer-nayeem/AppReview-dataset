Oh dear Google should make devs state what each update does, another update and no description of what the update does, and now it can't be moved to memory card after this latest update. Oh and the latest update puts an add in the app to choose other Apps to download, thought I paid for the pro version to get rid of ads
Does not work Needs an update It crashes all the time when I try to change ringtone on Android 6.0.
Was great, now it won't let me create. 5 star is now 2 till fixed
Rellllllly' I bought the app and it sayas that there is a liscence error
It won't let me change the tones on my phone. It says ringtone changed but it doesn't do it. How can I fix this If not I want my money back.
