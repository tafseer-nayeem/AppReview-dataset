Not saving progress Great game, but for some reason it has stopped saving my progress.  Its is very frustrating because I now can't make my boost go any higher. Have lost over 100 games of progress because of this, please help
Buggy Unable to save progress and pick up game on second device and I often lose saved game data on same device.  Customer service ignored my email on the issue so I'm giving Threes a crappy review and moving on. It's a shame because it's actually a great game.
