Guess the movie This game is horrible not only do you have to pay to get hints when you run out of them. The free version you can even download on your phone otherwise I would not expensive 1.99
Boring Not what I expected. I found it very boring and tedious. Uninstalled it after a week.
Lost my premium status I haven't played this game for a while then when i came back my premium status that i paid for disappeared..
Fun game but it crashes constantly
Worth it This game is quite fun. Worth the money i spent
