Not possible to add credit card I have tried using both Visa and Amex, Amex just fails straight up, and I cant add an visa card, why
Wallet is broken Your wallet is broken. It rejects all cards.
Not convenient
Location fails Why can't I manually add my location What if I'm not exactly at the point where I'm gonna be picked up yet but I wanna ask for a service earlier so I don't have to wait that long Or YOUR GPS TRACKER SUCKS AND ITS SAIS I AM WHERE IM NOT Plus there are many places like malls that you don't know the number but you HAVE TO provide it or the service won't work. Seriously, fix that stuff.
No vehicle options available App is horrible, could not request for different types of taxi like uber. Not like uber which you can request for different types of vehicle for large parties.
Can't enter phone number correctly I want to give my phone number signing up,  but when I put my country.  It gives me another country code.  Do impossible to sign up
Adding card issues Couldn't try the service because simply I can't add my credit card, says adding is not possible try again later though it is the same card i use for UBER and all other apps
Service Unavailable I used this app previously to travel to airport from home and it was working great. However not the same this time. It failed me when I needed the most. Prompt  Service Unavailable at current location Living in central area no service yet. Crap
Trash Tried this app and it failed instantly. First I tried to order a taxi and it said that service was not offered in that area. When I called the number I was able to get a cab easily. Next I tried adding a card and failed on several attempts, even though the card is perfectly valid. Will not be using again.
