Wow not fun bummer take ing my data I hate it The person do sent move half of the time and gets hit magicly by I do air fall do sent get back up and glitches and falls off of the course used up all my coins can't get past 3 level wow sucky game 
Waste of Money Don't bother wasting your money on this crap.  The controls are confusing and half the time do not work.  It's hard to get the characters to move at all some times.  Getting past the third level is quite difficult and there's just not much to the game.  It looks good, but it's just not that much fun.  Get the second one, it's free, the controls are infinitely easier and there's a lot more to it.
HATE IT HATE HATE HATE IT A WASTE OF TIME GLITCHES
NO This game is fun... the first time you play it. It's hard to get them to run and jump. You have to but other levels with the coins which is stupid. And finally I bought a helmet and it didn't show up. I WANT A REFUND
Very intrusive Why does it need access to my call information Oh and also my photos and files.
Wipeout2 is a lot better This game freezes up it was a waste of my money don't get it get the 2nd wipeout instead it doesn't cost and works a lot better
Terrible It is so frustrating that is almost threw my phone out the window.  When i play i always make it but it makes me restart the obstacle. Waste of money
Does not work It sucks i try to duck but it jumps really quickly and i cant dodge anything please fix it
Didn't save When i got a new phone i didnt give me all the stuff i purchased on the game
