Waste of money When you start everything looks quite simple. However other civilisations seem to spread much quicker than you can. Once you take over another area, it isn't long before you are attacked and lose everything you have gained. This game becomes boring very quickly. Total waste of money.
Great game. Terribly optimized Game is great in practice, nice little fun, but it runs really slowly on my HTC 1, which is pretty unacceptable, lack of sound also detracts from making some semblance of atmosphe whatsoever.
Its a decent game but u cannot play it on the LG g2 and g3 at all so until optimised i cannot give it a 5
No strategy This game is just a thinly veiled movement of numbers. There is little strategy available. If your numbers are first, good for you. If your numbers are last, bad for you. Too often there is a land grab between two states, and they both attack an opponent, and both irrevocably  go to war afterward. It's a bad game.
