What to do What we have to do when they get married in church and the girl touches the rose please reply within 5 days other wise il uninstall this app and there should not be bug fixes
OMG IT IS TERRIBLE Bleeeegh HORRIBLE On the first wedding no one bothers to come Are they getting married in secret All of the pretty dresses, hair, accessories and shoes are locked You have to pay for them All the other coco games are the same You either watch an add or you pay After you watch lots of adds you'll have to pay I uninstalled after the first wedding. Then the bride stood there and I didn't know what to do
It is like other fashoin or make up games and no one in the weddinghave come what stupid game and when we make the boy and the girl dance it is so stupid dance hate it. Make some changes
Not like real wedding Why didn't they kiss
IS THE GAME FREE The game is not free if YOU have to pay for things
So bad This game is so bad because everything is locked and then you have to buy it all
Assuming you are not allowed to be a little late today is my new number one priority to U.S. military has been the best way for me know Hate
