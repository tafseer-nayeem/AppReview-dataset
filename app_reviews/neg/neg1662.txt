Off line not as advertised I've purchased the app to use the offline topo maps but,  it will never show you where you at properly  your location button doesn't do anything... Map take a lot to upload or whe it does it's just half of it....Other than that the start track or check in is not showing....
Freezes every time I try to use it
Content dated, app horrible 4.00... Expensive for an app, especially one this clunky. Runs slow, doesn't work offline, map is useless, app often craps out to show the html web structure this app is a thin veneer over... have to refilter lists every time you open a trail and go back to your list eg state list. Unfortunately, this app had a more complete if dated  trail reviews from years ago really most current set of trails than the superpolished MTBProject app... So, useful... But just barely.
Worthless Does not show trail maps. Topo maps are available for free on Google maps.  I was misled into believing this app would have trail maps.  App is useless.  Waste of 4.
Confused about the maps I bought the topo map version so I could get the trail maps, but all it shows is an area map, no trails. Not even a trail head. What's the point Trying to find help or faq online.
Trust the negative reviews I really wanted the negative reviews to be wrong as I really wanted this to be a good app. The maps are poor quality, and you are better sticking with Google maps. I can it belive I wasted 5 dollars on this.
Slow, clumsy, and very little British Columbia trail info Waste of time if you live in Canada
Doesn't work on Z3
