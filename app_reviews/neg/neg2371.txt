Absolutely Horrible I've only had this game for less than 24 hrs and it keeps crashing  the game seems fun but I a soon as I finish a race the game turns off and I lose all the progress  if I could give this game zero I would
stupid game i paid for it and top up the money, just bo buy to best car to rule the game. and it turn out that the stupid game is just to add up your frustration. the difficulty level is completely unnecessary. the car cannot break, and competitor car is way faster than me. playing thia game does not make u relax. instead it makes u mad.
Galaxy Note 3 Samsung never has issues with anything. I'm about to refund because it's force closed twice already and I have the sound bug as well. This game could've been REAL cool. I'm upset in have to refund this. But I'm not keeping this crap if it doesn't function properly. Dang dude disappointed
App crashes everytime I played one level of championship. From second level I'm not able to play the game. It crashes every time even I have 300 MB free space. Really frustrated. Refund my money.
Crashes When it doesn't because of Google play it's a good game. But it happens far to often.
