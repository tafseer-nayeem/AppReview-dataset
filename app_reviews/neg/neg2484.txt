Not starting in my mobile I upgraded my Android One to Marshmallows 6.0. After that Shiva the time Bender not starting one circle keep on moving at bottom right side. Please advise..
Hate it for latest version I have installed the game but when I open it it says an error its a nice good Graphics I'll five stars if it would play in my mobile and I am using micromax canvas juice A177
Not fair 1. Every era should have different bosses. there are only 2 bosses which are different.  2.There are 6 eras but there are only 4 avatars should have 6 avatars and weapons.                                                               I will be happy if you add this in the next update. I will give 5 stars PLS ADD
Good game but The game restarts every time u die... Have to defeat the same boss every time.... 
Bug in collecting orbs.. New orbscoins are counted nt all ..

Crashes I can't play longer or pass 2 stages because the game mostly crashes when I clear the first or second stage. I'm using Samsung Galaxy Pocket

Stupid graphics and boring I don't understand why did they name it Shiva when the avatar was Goku from dragon ball. Stupid background, going by the name it could have been much better
