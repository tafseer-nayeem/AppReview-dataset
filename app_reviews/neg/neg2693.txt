Constant interference It is a decent quiz but in between they will have a pop up asking to give them a rating constantly. Also it is almost only about India so it is not actually general knowledge
Not so worthy app as it contains wrong answers .... And also unusual notifications comes to play gk quiz even keeping phone in flight mode .... Thats not good
Disgusting Whoever reading this notice, I giving advice to u plz not install it....
Problems with language I just downloaded this app and I clearly specified my language of preference as English but it still asks me questions in Hindi and Telugu.Please help me fix this problem and I will give it a fivestar rating
Laudable work by Jagran Josh. The programming team of the app is always on one foot to help the users. The problem I had with the recurring notifications was fixed when I reinstalled.
It always goes to the main menu while playing the game
Friends ke sath online quiz kheli jaye to or accha app ho jayega.
