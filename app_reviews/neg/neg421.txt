Flipagran I different now I used to could add a song now it's just clips
Pointless Why have the video feature if the videos don't even show up Everything is distorted When this is fixed I will gladly reinstall the app.
Don't install glitches It has glitches messes up my pic
Messes  up way to much Can't make videos. Dont play when I post them. Stops working all the time. It's not worth getting
I would love to give this app a 0 I try to put a music on my video but I can't
Stops working I have been trying to make a video for my husbands bday...and everytime its time to make the video...the app stops working...beyond frustrating....after hours of adding and editing pics...i cant finish the video.
 The app changes my colors of my pics it looks so messed up and ugly other than that I love the app
Flipagram keeps on acting up Whenever I put my videos it always says the there is something wrong with it
When I go to resume my video the app stops
Eh It never let me sign in it never let me create anything all in all it's rubbish
The music won't load it sucks
Does not load my videos I finish the whole thing then go to prepare the video and it says unfortunately it has stopped running right when it gets to like 97 complete every time Would not recommend this app to anyone
It always kick me off in the middle of making my video.
Cant put the music I want I would really like of u we could use the music we want without it saying that there is something wrong with me using this song and u Flipagram is fixing it wen its been over months and it never got fixed
