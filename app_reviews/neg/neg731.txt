Not in South Africa Why don't you make it clear before we wast our data downloading the wrong application. This application is not for S.A. Please rectify this.
 Please note. It only gets one star because I can't give it a 0
Mickey Mouse app Ekse there are all these other places where is SA You must say there is no SA before I download.
Will like this app if i can put in South Africa as do not live in other places
Bad Why u don't state that it excludes South Africa. Stupid app in fact useless to South Africans don't waste your data bundles downloading it
