Not able to download I have Verizon FiOS quantum internet so that's not the problem
Kinda disappointed It was stupid funny it would've been an awesome game except it was just way to short to be worth 3.00.
I feel mislead I thought I was paying 3 bucks for a game, not a bizarre ten minute indie film. I wish that I had the option to get my money back, I literally saved up my Google Opinion survey rewards money for like two weeks to download this. Totally bummed.
Waste of money 3 dollars for a 5 minute game. I don't know how this got 4 12 stars
Sucks I payed 3 dollars for this and it doesn't even work it kicks me out after it says etter studios Pls fix it so you can play it on android and I will give it 5 stars. Plsssssss
Can't play I keep trying to play it but then it exits out on itself...would really love to play, interesting concept...
Nothing New If you've seen the short film which is free on Vimeo, don't waste your money on this game. The game doesn't add anything new or supplement the film at all, it's just like watching the film except you have to touch the screen to make things happen. Not worth 3 at all.
DO NOT BUY IT its funny yes, but not 3 funny for 5 min of playing. And that five min of playing is beating the game. Thats it. I cant believe i wasted my money on this... so please DO NOT BUY THIS
Waste of time and money There's no aim of this game and it's ended within 1 hour of starting, this is the most stupid thing that I deal with . Don't pay any cent  for this one and its even doesn't deserve to be under the title GAME.
