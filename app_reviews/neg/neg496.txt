I am fine with everything in the app.. but everytime i make a booking the Citrus payment gateway takes for ever to get me thru and fails most of the time.. i really wish Indigo changes their gateway.. lousy show stopper.. i have wasted 25 minutes so far retrying ... 
Purely pathetic This is the worst app I have ever used. Web check in fails all the time. Seat doesn't get allocated. While booking ticket, payment fails continuously. The only consistent message I get from this app is we are encountering some problem. Please try after some time. Extreme frustration.
Awful UX  useless if you're not from India Missing lots of the features from the website couldn't change currency couldn't enter an international phone number had my DOB listed as 01Jan1800 in the app, despite it being correct on the website. Ultimately failed in its primary mission  to sell me a plane ticket. Awful.
Pls update the app Armed forces personal option is available in the website but in application it is not available so I hate this app. No use for me. Few more options also not available in the app.
Disappointing... I cant book a ticket by using defence quota.... Please help me... Im a regular traveler in Indigo
add armed force personell feature. armed force personell facility not available in app
No option for armed services It's useless for me because there no option for armed forces I have to go to websites to book a flight disappointed a lot I wanted to give no star but 1 is minimum I can give
App gets crashed.... When trying to search the pnr status app gets hanged and closed.
i have my pnr and i cant recieve my itnerary on email...very confusing..worst flight ever..totally user unfriendly
Isme armed forces keliye Nayi hain
Not working properly One way option not getting select.  And destination also not getting select how any one can see the flight
Stupid app Shows last name invalid.. don't download
