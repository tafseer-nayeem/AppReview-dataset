Started off great.. Liked the layout until I couldn't tweet, favorite, mention...anything. It just became a feed reader... And the annoying mention notifications going off constantly even after reading them. Had to delete even though I just paid for the prime version
Make a one off payment and you get a stupid banner add, i pay to remove add.
Ads I paid for this app and i still got ads.... Other than that it was OK. I got a refund.
