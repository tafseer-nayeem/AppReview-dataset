This app is a ripoff It won't open the vce files and also won't load on my tablet without me paying again.
Stops Working and Crashes In the middle of exams, the app crashes. Not sure if this is due to an update but it wasnt like this before. Please apply a patch if so I would like to know if I can get my money back..
