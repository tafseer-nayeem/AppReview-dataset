Doesn't work I have the other 2 Ghost Radar apps and they work 10 times better than this one and they were free.
Joke is too kind a description This app absolutely sucks.  Not sure why expected anything else but I did.  The words it confess up with are just ridiculous  jungle  the  switch  Yeah those words are just full of otherworldly meaning lol.  One  is two too many  they owe me one. UNINSTALL
Ghost radar Hoax,  I read about this app on Reddit and decided to see for myself.  Its such BS that i cant fully explain how lame it is.  At 99 cents i figured WTH,  I would imagine if anyone gave a crap they would be sued.  Buy an ouija board and let your shifty friend trick you.  If you want e mail me and i will text random words and colorful dots for the spirits  seems to be a ploy to take advantage of the mourning.
Interesting... I'm only giving 3 stars till I can get more factual evidence. App runs great though  update I'm starting to think this app is fake...
GIVE IT BACKKK I WANT MY NONEY BACK NOWWWW YOU PPL WILL REGRET NOT GIVING NY MONEY BACK
I paid for this why am I getting ads This makes no sense.
Requires Access to Messages I don't understand if this app is real, why must it access my messages This may be one of many ways it trys to convince you there are real ghosts nearby.
