Not Samsung compatible I'm getting between 1200 notifications a week from the smart manager notifying that this app is causing my device to run slowly. I like others have reached out for help, but 3 weeks and 3 emails later, I'm still waiting for help.    ETA, update not fixed problem.
Problem with fade Generally I love the app although I wish there were community created presets or something. My issue is with the fading on alarms. Instead of starting really dim and gradually getting brighter, they start out at 100 brightness at the start of the fade. Please fix this.
Doesn't work Cannot connect to bridge
This app makes the device run slow Get that pop up message and vibration 10 times a day... On galaxy s5
Great app when it wants to work I paid for a app that sometimes works,the music feature keeps cutting off. I have to go back to the app to reconnect to the bridge. Major hassle. Would have given it 5 stars if it worked properly
Consistently inconsistent Samsung Galaxy S5 user here.   This is full of bugs.   Please don't waste your money.  When using the app sometimes lights come on randomly after a timer is used to turn off lights.  Widget is very inconsistent and intermittent.
Hue Pro at one time worked well.  Every now and then it would lose a connection, about once every 23 months.  Now, Hue Pro can only connect when I uninstall HuePro, and then install it again.  Suffice to say, if I was a new user I would NOT buy this app unless you want redownload it again and again.  I bought it to use the widget but because I have to redownload it repeatedly the widget settings get lost.  It was a great app, now its not something I can recommend to end users.
