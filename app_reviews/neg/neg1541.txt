Lying sack of wate my time I did a search for a question, the answer came up on Quora. Before I could read it I was forced to load and install the app first I tried going back to the answer page but was repeatedly hijacked to the install page. The install page promised that as soon as I loaded the app I would see my answer...NOT I will uninstall Quora and never actually see if it had any useful answers because it is so rigid and anal, and lied to me and wasted my time. Way too anal.
V.poor search option Quora had an above average search option, which the developers have downgraded to an ultra poor one. Everytime I try searching a person or a topic, the search bar just stands still. Search is to search content on quora goddamit Not to show me the 'recently asked question'. It would really help if you could look into this issue. Else the app is great.
Became very slow after last update Not working properly on phone, website has its own issues.
Bad update After last update it is glitching a lot and tries to force close everytime I try to expand a long answer, moreover the scrolling speed has become worse. Please fix.
New update is worse Latest update is so worse. It takes so much time to load just a single answer. I don't know when you are going to solve this issue but for the past 2 weeks I have not read an answer on quora. Before I could read answers on offline mode but now I simply can't.  Thanks to your update you ruined all the fun of quora...
Bad Now after update using Quora is no more fun way to obtain knowledge,loading whole content has became so much irritating...please put back our good Quora back.....
This update totally sucks. After removing the search option how can one find about the topic he's interested. Please restore the previous update or include search option in the next version.
