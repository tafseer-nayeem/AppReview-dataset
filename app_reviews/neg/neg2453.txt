A bad interpretation of Quest I used to play the game as a kid and there was no way you would miss so often nor get ambushes that are stronger than the dungeon's boss super regularly. It is absolutely crazy and ruins the game. The amount of microtransactions the game forces on you to unlock monsters and heroes is also out of this world.
1 star because it only gives you 56 hours of gaming, after that, you have to buy an expansion 5 or repeat the content again. Fun but repetitive game, but for this kind of prices I would play anything else.
Fun but... It keeps losing my saves and I have to keep starting over.... what gives
IAP is obscenely priced. The game is really just okay, graphics are very good.  I love the original boardgame but the in app purchases are a hell of a shame here.  Let me pay one fee rather than this highly priced drip feedrat pellet scheme that you are offerring.
Constant crashes on my Asus tablet but the game killing bug is I can't read any text on item descriptions or quest text. It's just a jumbled scrolling mess.
Appalled by the IAP prices and hence the greedy dev's. If I'd bought this game for anything else than a hefty discount, I'd refunded instantly.
Cannot log into the game I liked the game and spent money on it but now it never gets past syncing and I cannot play it.
Repetitive and dull No challenge, just keep levelling up going it will get better but it doesn't
