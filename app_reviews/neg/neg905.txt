Have to reset after each day I absolutely loved this app the first day I tried it. But when it wouldn't give me a next day, I thought it was my error, so I tried all sorts of things to try to get it to work. When it didn't again, I contacted support but never heard back from them. Really disappointed, and particularly since I paid for it. It would absolutely be worth it IF IT WORKED.
Excercise pop up I hate that the exercise screen pops up every time I open the app. I wish the water was customizable. Otherwise it's fine to track my containers.
Doesn't work To much work.
Confusing. Not convenient. They know the program, but not convenient.
Don't purchase I've had a very hard time navigating through the app and an even more difficult time trying to figure out how to get the information I netted from it. The iPhone version is far superior. This is rubbish
The iPhone version is much better. You can log your measurements and edit your meal plans.  Would get a better review if the app For GoogleSamsung was like the iPhone app. This is just a knock off of better app.
The iPhone app is way better. Let's you modify almost everything. I can't seem to edit anything without starting over. IPhone app also allows you to opt out of using half container. Make this better please
This is useless It won't let me enter anything or  does it calculate my containers for me. It doesn't have the Extreme choices either. This is horrible
