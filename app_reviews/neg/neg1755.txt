Exelent app This app can make safe driving and protect life
Rubbish App isn't intelligent to suggest alternate routes but wants you to go through heavy traffic just because the route is faster.  It's no time saver and it's no Google Navigate. Far far far away.
Need more That application need to develop it more, It not show the reality and 80 of traffic states
Inaccurate Shows streets as green while its crowded. . Needs improvement
Nothing is matching Nothing is matching the reality
Doesn't satisfy my need When the street is very crowded and the cars are not moving it gives you Green  Check Salwa road from Midmak bridge to Qatar decoration roundabout
Cool Ya it's good...
