Banned It's so mean I was banned for doing nothing

Sucks Won't load anymore.
Available updated version for android I can't broadcast unless I update to version 4.2 or above, but there isn't another update option available for me
Well It's a great Idea and I love the people on there but it barely ever loads and lags so much and it's so annoying and frustrating and I'm pretty sure it gave a virus on my phone
Trash Stop sending me notifications. I turned them off for a reason you worthless morons. Learn how to code.
Frustrating At first it started working really good, but now in the middle of a broadcast or two seconds into one it'll cut it and asked me to restart only to find out that my user has been broadcasting this whole time. needs a lot of fixing not as good as it used to be.
Wtf I was banned for no reason. Please fix that. Other than that its great.
Banned I barely created an account and it says I'm banned. What
NO ONE GET THIS APP IT SUCKS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOBAD IF U GET THIS APP U WILL REGRET IT I PROMISE
It's not even the same anymore Why can't i see other people's comments on younow. I can only see them if I go back then click on the broadcaster, I hate this smh 
Restricted all social stuff like brodcasting and guest thingy also messages hate it.
Wtf... I can't see the chat when I broadcast. And now it doesn't even let me broadcast.
Disappointment Why can't I connect to Younow on my wifi
Really I got banned for changing my name I can't do nothing now I can't even change my name back I can't comment I can't do anything but watch stupid little kids do not install waste of time
