Only for one player You can only keep track one one players stats and only one player can take advantage of boons. I doubt my friends will be excited about the fact that I can do all of this cool stuff and they get dice for level counters.
Shamefully bad This is really really amazingly terrible. Such a disappointment. It looks really outdated. I would've said it looks outdated 3 years ago. It has an easily reproducible crash. It's just bad. I hope you guys update this soon. I love Munchkin and I'm more than happy to give you 5 for a simple app like this, but for that price this should be flawless.
Could be better If the level counter also had a bonus counter and an easier to use killometer that automatically took those 2 stats I would rate it higher.
Over priced For what this app offers it is very over priced. There are just as good free versions about that do the same job. It seems you are paying for the Munchkin artwork and boons.
No offline use. Love SJ games, not being able to use it offline is terrible.
Waste of money. This app will continuously ask you if it wants to reset while you are using it. Just use a pen and paper.
It's the wrong resolution. Unusable bc the resolution is wrong and everything is to big to use. Wish I could give it 0 stars.
Update We have been using this app for ages and you think that they might add cuthulu or some of the the newer sets
Doesn't track gear
The custom feature does not function. The app still has not received any updates for any of the newer versions of Munchkin that have been released in recent years.
