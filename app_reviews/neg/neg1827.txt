Very glitchy no pun intended. Game stops when you put the tablet to sleep, then you have to power off and restart the tablet to get it going again. Scene changes are incredibly slow you're not sure if your screen tap registered or not. This makes game play painful. Very good ending though.
Doesn't work My app won't load keeps giving me error when I try to open app.
Not compatible  with mouse single point  devices like the previous 2 versions.  Can't press multiple buttons. turn 4  keys Fix or refund my money please
Has a glitch Doesn't start anymore, can't run it. I don't understand how they didn't see that during beta testing on LG g3
Won't load Game won't load on my Samsung Galaxy Alpha. Never had a problem with any of your other games. I have been checking every week for this game and was extreamly excited to see that it had been released but am really disappointed that I cant get it to load. Just says the game has stopped working after just opening I hope this if fixed soon
Paid twice Had to buy the game 2 times because it wouldn't let me open it and when i uninstall it and installed it again in hopes it would let me play but i had to pay again and it still won't let me open it, i love forever lost and have been waiting almost 2 years for episode 3, i will give the full five star rating when i recieve a refund for the second time i had to pay
Way to hard Puzzles are very hard. Clues are way over your head. Being this hard takes the fun out of the game. Had to use a hint on almost everything.
