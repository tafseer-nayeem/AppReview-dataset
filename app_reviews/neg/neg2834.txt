Badd It won't let me play every time I go on the game it give me a loading blue screen then it goes black
Permissions I'd understand if you needed inapp purchase permission only, but why device call and ID and other Care to explain in description
I updated the game and all the levels above 150 disappeared and it shows a bunch of levels as locked that I've done, and levels after those are unlocked..how can this be fixed
AND AGAIN....Every time this ap gets an update, I have to repeat levels. What's up with that No one has answered me
