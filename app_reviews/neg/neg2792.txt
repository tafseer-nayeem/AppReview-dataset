Ridiculous This was supposed to be a free app. Then I get charged for it. And now can't get a refund because the fifteen minute window is closed. Shame on this app. I'd be saying a lot worse but I'm holding my tongue
I wish I could give a worse star You shouldn't have an in app purchases that a 3 yr old child can easily tap on.  Lucky for me she was distracted and didn't press the purchase button to get rid of the random popup like she always do. Or I would be out 10. uninstalling
Over priced This is a kids app  It's over priced. For this reason I will not buy it.
Instead of kids educational apps being free they want us to pay.
Dont bother downloading If you want a free fun app search elsewhere. It constantly asks you to pay for new levels. And it is frustrating for kids and adults alike 
Pathetic Do not waste your time on installing this app. Its horrible, I had it for only one day and only two rooms are free and I finished it within 10 minutes trust me do not install this app.
Uncalled for You know I can't stand kids apps that get you to click an advertisement to download another app or link to website.  My daughter playing and goes to puzzle and right in center of screen pops a window that of course she will click on and it takes her to the play store to download another app.  Kind of ruins the experience.

Overpriced I wouldn't recommend buying the additional puzzles. Way overpriced  The entire app is 'free app' quality.
