Not working Would rate more stars seeing as i have quite a few of the bradford learning games for 4 of my children, this is the only one that after purchasing says it cannot load on this tablet... If this is fixable will give higher rating
Doesn't work charged twice I thought this would work better than free version,  but I was charged twice and it won't even start.  I've sent messages with no response.
Doesnt work well The apps music and talking do not work well sometimes scrambles. App quits working alot. Wish I would have stuck with the free version.
