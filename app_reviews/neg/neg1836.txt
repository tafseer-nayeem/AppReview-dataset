Keeps shutting down And I paid 1.99 for this. I live the game but kerps shutting down and taking me to my home page, losing all of my accomplishments.   not happy Samsung Galaxy S5
Wish I could refund it The game play is awful and the emphasis is not on what you can draw. If you would like a game with more possibilities get scribblenauts
