Just wow.. this app doesnt have anything, we eso players are looking for. if this was a true reference guide we should be able to call this app our best friend. sorry my friends but this is not what anyone is looking for.
Incomplete Maps are incomplete, hard to read and navigate.  Listsspreadsheets of recipes and requirements for crafting would be helpful.     Not bad IF IT WAS A FREE APP as a reference but very little information beyond a basic user guide.  Much less reliable and useful than a quick Google search on most topics.
This app is ridiculous I payed for this app and you cant even take the time too keep it up too date this is just absurd
