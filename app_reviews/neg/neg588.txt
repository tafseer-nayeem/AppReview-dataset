Still waiting for this app to be fixed. July 27 WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO FIX THIS PROBLEM  I WANT A REFUND Was great for about 3 days and now won't open. Do I get reimbursed if it continues not to work Please fix I have a very sad little boy and a very upset mama.
App is crashing I been waiting for  more than 1 month and the app still keeps crashing, please fix it now because I'm making youtube videos and I can't record the Glorp Corp land. Everytime I click play, the app will crash, please fix this problem. It won't even let me play the game anymore. I don't recommend anyone to buy this app just yet, until they fix the problem.

Don't believe you Every time I download this I press the start button and it stays loading foreverfix this problem because I want a refundthis game is ''67''
Cannot play anymore After passing a certain point, I am no longer able to play this game. Every time I press the play button on the menu screen, the game closes itself. After paying for this game, I expect to be able to play it. If you cannot fix this glitch, I want a refund.

Until they fix it I will give just 1 star. ...it worked before
What New update lags and app keeps stopping. It wasn't like this before
