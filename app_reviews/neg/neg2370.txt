Money issue Bought it wouldnt let me instal it till a day later so I got my moneys worth but it worried me that my money just was taken at least I know I got the game and all is the same now.
Please fix it, it's too awesome to remain broken. Fantastic game... until it started crashing on me before I even got to the game menu. Also this game is quite horrible with a DS4, disappointing since it's a great controller.
Good but still lags badly on Snapdragon 805 Note 4. Please optimize for Galaxy Note 4. Laggy frame rate.......
nice but... Nice graphics. I have Samsumg Note 4 Exynos model SMN910C, and at the Shaders Complexity settings when turn from medium to high the game crashes. fix this please i ll give 5 stars.
Useless Does not open most of the time on a Samsung Galaxy S6. Have been sending feedback for months without a response.  Great game if it only worked.  And yes I have tried clearing everything and reinstalling the app. nothing solves the problem.
