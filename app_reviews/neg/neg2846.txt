Not to good ok the run Well when I'm going on like a road trip I like to play this but one thing I don't like is the locks should actually should be like money sign for like fake money in the game  because some little kids like me may wanna play this game and they probably don't want to steal there parents credit card..... reasonus I hate the adds
I thought about giving this only one star, but I do like a lot of the things you can do on it. However, I'm very annoyed that after I exit the game and then open it up like 30 minutes later, I have to go back and get the free things over again.
