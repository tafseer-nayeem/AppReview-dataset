Don't even play I've installed it twice, both times its crashed as soon as it gets past the login wFacebook, then shuts off
Dead It died on my phone when I updated it last time. I had been waiting for another update and got it today but it's still all black every time I run the app. Got really upset 
I luv playing dis game but every time y'all update it I can't play  its urking my nerves y'all need 2 get dat fix asap
I'm on level 59 and have been stuck there because it blows up my cards and asks me to try again.Please fix
Great challenge for the brain. The video want show so now I cant get my thousand dollars
I like this game.  But there are so many issues lately with getting it to load at the start up screen. It just keeps going on the same loop that takes you back to the login page over and over again.  I plan on deleting the game if these issues are not resolved soon.
To hard. I really like this game but its to hard. You need to either rethink some of the levels or make it easier to get coins. I waste thousands of coins on some of the levels before I can pass it. its bull. I'm about ready to delete it. These levels should cost 3500 coins or more and the daily log in bonus is only 3000 makes no sense
Love this game and would give 5 stars but since the update it won't let me play which sucks if not fixed soon I will end up deleting this game
Love the game Hate that since it updated my game won't load it freezes before the board even loads.
We need to be able to collect more coins rather than 10 times a day.
