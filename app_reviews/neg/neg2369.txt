Fun for a bit.... Gets very boring and repetitive after a while. Please add better vehicle customization and multiplayer. Also delivery missions was a great thing that was taken away
STOP BUGGING ME TO RATE Lovin the game but i paid for it and should be able to play it without being constantly bugged to rate it, i haven't finished it yet so you get one star.edit,  I've rated it and it's STILL bugging me to rate itedit maybe it won't stop bugging me to rate it until i give it more than one star.  Not going to do that until it stops bugging me to rate.
A tired sequel RR2 is a better game. Same physics, same graphics, better cars, and the car mods missing from rr3. Edit deducted 1 more star for terrible controller support.
Why No Tilt steering Why no tilt steering like all the others Would be great...
