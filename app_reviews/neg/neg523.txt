Stopped working Worked fine for a few minutes and just stopped refreshing data. Refresh button on server select screen doesn't refresh data either while rusty sheriff refreshes just fine so not a connection issue. Once in a blue moon it does connect but only for a little bit.  45 stars for the UI design. 15 for functionality and reliability. Awaiting next version in hopes for fixes and improvements.
Worst Never updates server to see info  you can't see game chat.
Doesn't work anymore Was working fine tell it crashes every time you load it. so sad you broke something so good. Samsung galaxy note 3
DO NOT WASTE MONEY New Multiple servers show rcon for all servers very confusingThis app used to be OK, its still flawless on a crap empty server, try this on a 30 server it lags and crashes, on a 90player server its about as responsive as a dead cat, good luck trying to type in console with even 30 people online... Don't know what's been done but god sake this is utterly useless for me right now.
Can't connect I can't connect to my server. I've triple checked the connection info and it fails to connect
Was working till update Says I need new sdk I'm on 4.4.2 on note 3
It's pretty handy, still very buggy for the price I paid. I'd like to see an easier way to chat as server console implemented. Also I think the player list needs to refresh we  you pull down as this doesn't seem to happen.
