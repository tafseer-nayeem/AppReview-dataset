Barely installed... Barely installed this app  it keeps telling me the app unfortunately stopped every single time I try to input a temp or hours slept. Not sure what the malfunction is.
Well... Not working with irregular cycles, shows decreasing chances to get pregnant even before ovulation occured. Automatically applied period while still in the 'two week wait', very disappointing when ttc Uninstalling
The first time I had this app it was amazing, but now it's a different story.  I just installed it on my new phone and I keep trying to put in my info to log in,but it keeps saying there's a problem with the host and it won't let me log in. I even tried to make another one,it does the same thing. I hope this gets fixed,I would love to be able to use this app again.
I love this app but it wint let me log in Please help.
