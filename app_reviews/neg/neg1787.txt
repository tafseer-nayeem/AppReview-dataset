Needs to be reliable I'm a serious deer hunter and need to heavily rely on the app. Have had it for years. As another review mentioned the sunriseset has on several occasions like right now been WAY off. I'm an all or nothing kind of guy. It either works as stated or it doesn't. If I pay you for something I expect it to work, and if you developer have been told it's broken for years then you have no excuse for not fixing it. Make it reliable and 1star becomes 5 stars.
Cyan Flashlight 2.13  despite facing compatibility problems as well enlisted the help of the public to troubleshoot it and developed a patch to address it for those who could not get the flashlight to work so if any of us paying customers who miss the flashlight that this app use to have we can get it from them
