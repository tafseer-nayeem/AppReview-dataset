Not work on Samsung Galaxy S4 This game is not work on my galaxy s4 smart phone.  What's problem on my phone  But this is very fine  awesome. I'm requesting you game developer please suggest me way this game is not work on my phone  .
It won't load properly on my android tablet, I can hear the music but the screen is blank My 3 year old is really disapointed .
Great in theory but... The app crashes every time we reach the screen where we have to take passengers on board. As soon as we click a passenger, bam, app crashes us back to the phones hone screen. Frustrating for me, but even more frustrating from my train obsessed toddler
Very frustrating Experiencing problems when trying to refuel the train. My 3 year old couldn't do it and when I tried myself I've found it just doesn't work. The hand gesture help tip suggests you swipe up near the pump but I've swiped every direction a million times, pressed, tapped and everything between but cannot get past this section. Dissapointing as my son loved it. Problems occurring on Sony tablet Z
