AI moves past what a player should know The first 20 games the AI acts like a real player.  Once it catches on that you play decent, the AI becomes aware of the card layout in ways that it could not possibly know, hand after hand after hand.  Destroys the enjoyment of the game.
Really liked this the first few months.  But for some reason the same player always gets the queen now at least 75  80 of the time and consequently that player reaches 100 first.  Its not just a losing streak.  Its been doing this for close to a month now.  I really liked the graphics so its disappointing.
Rip off It worked when I download it but when I went back to play again it was frozen and would not let me play. This is the second hearts game I'v bought. That quit working shortly after I got it. What's up with that
Hearts Low rating because it jams every 23 days and I have to go thru the disinstallinstall process each time.
Garbage 4th  Final Not enough space here to list all the cheats I saw.  Final straw caught it leading Hearts before they were broken Yes, it's proving difficult to play fair.  It's worth 99 cents.
Two of Clubs Why is it dealing me the 2 of clubs more often than the odds would suggest
Sucks Game is designed to deal out wins and losses. Determined to achieve a percentage of wins or loses. No random deals.
Extremely limited options and inconsistent AI Stunned there is no option for 'hitting on the first trick'.  Hearts games issued years ago had this simple feature.  Also, the AI is inconsistent at the 5 star ratings.
Terrible  game It cheats,  not fun when the game cheats,  don't waste your money  or time.
