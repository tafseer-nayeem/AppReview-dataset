Appears to be abandoned I had high hopes when I first downloaded and played this but it's not been updated for nearly 7 months now and it's still basically just a demo with very little content to keep your interest.
Weak for a paid game I thought by buying the game would unlock so much more. It doesn't the game is just boring....add species to the game people or even let u create planets like within our own solar system.
Unfiar Hated it i wanted a refund under 1 hour and they did not give me it every one rate 1star come on guys
TOPIA IDEAS This DEFINITELY wasnt worth 2 dollars. A fun game but not worth that much. I think it would be really cool if you could develop the animals into sentient races that built townscities and shrines to you and that allowed you more power. Being able to control more species at the same time. It would also be cool to make leaders in the races and send them off to battle etc. It would be cool to have mythical creatures.  Has potential but sucks right now. I payed, it should be better.
Wont download Paid for it.. download got to a megabyte left and stopped.. refunded and retried.. same deal..and now wont let me refund so im stuck with a purchase that wont download.
