I can't even play the game I purchased the game this past weekend and I haven't been able to play it since. The game errors out and does not load. Why have this in the play store when it's a piece of crap
Very cool game Over a year later and no updates, no bug fixes, pathetic.
Can't play I'm sure this game is awesome. One of my favorite characters of all time but of course I can't play the game. Downloaded successfully but every time I open the app it says it has stopped and wants me to file a report. I've filed a few reports but not even an email telling me I can't play it on my note 4
Won't work I will change my rating if someone can tell me how to fix it or just want my money back.
Stuck I keep getting stuck on level 28 the are really annoying and the predators are way to over powered make it easier and I'll rate 5 also the T and C buttons are to small and close together. One time I was doing a selth level and I was going to push C but instead I pushed T got detected and  failed the level so fix it and I will rate 5
I can't even start the game I have a droid turbo with 70 space and the moment I start the game I crashes no matter wat I do fix or tell me how to fix
