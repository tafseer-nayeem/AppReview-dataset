I don't understand why you need control of the camera in my phone in any way shape or form you are a gas price information service not a spy service
Verizonone1 I'm very unhappy with the company I make 400 points today and they take 800 points away in a day  that's a big  racket I'm closing my account
Lacking features, Not material design, ads Useful but could be much better. Need ability to leave commentsratings on stations and amenities free air, car wash type, cleanliness.... Needs price history and predictions for each region. Ads are everywhere and app unusable without xposed adblock. Too many intrusive permissions including auto start. All revoked.
Great app but killing battery The app is great but it is causing the bruedroidtimer wakelock to hold the phone awake even while screen is off, chewing battery in the process. What business does this app have even using Bluetooth Uninstalling, I'll use the mobile web site, same difference.
Battery  hog... I used to love this app but now... It is a battery hog. 18 battery use means I am uninstalling it. Recent updates were supposed to fix this but haven't. It uses more of the battery than Facebook Also doesn't compute completed tasks correctly... A great app that has been ruined.
Needs private info I don't mind ads, but I do mind publically sharing private info.
Update Since the last time I update I am not receiving my alerts when gas prices go up
