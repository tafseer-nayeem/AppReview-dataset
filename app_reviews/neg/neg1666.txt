Stop bugging me to rate app Haven't even had the app for an hour and still trying to figure out how it works but have had dozens of requests to rate it. Might rate higher later but if it doesn't stop bugging me I will delete it.

COULD NOT RENAME FILES OR MOVE FILES ... USELESS IF YOU CAN'T MOVE FILES FROM PHOBE TO SD OR RENAME THEM WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS APP THEN IT CONSTANTLY ASKS FOR FEEDBACK 
Just to stop the annoying reminder Works fine, reminder to rate every minute is really annoying.
Useless Get Could not move file error when trying to move files from ed card to phone storage. Even just moving one file. Also, nags every few seconds to give feedback do you like our app. Annoying, useless, uninstalled. HTC Amaze.
Doesn't work I was moving videos from another folder that I created but it doesn't appear in my gallery. Nothing is changed except that some of videos that I moved lost their thumbnails. Really stupid for me because it's not just it doesn't work, it broke my files too.  AHHHHHHHHHH THIS SURPASSED THE LEVEL OF STUPIDITY I EXPECTED THIS DOES JUST NOT WORK BUT REALLY DESTROY YOUR FILE I THOUGHT ITS JUST THE THUMBNAILS THAT IS BROKEN BUT IT TURNS OUT IT WAS THE VIDEO ITSELF CURSE THIS DONT DOWNLOAD
