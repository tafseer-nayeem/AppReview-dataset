Worked great .... for a while Loved having a simple app that was fast, easy and for the most part much more accurate than anything else I found. Today it can't find Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, but it can find a town of 2000 in Wis. Other problem is, it won't save the bookmarks of the places it can find.  Will give a 5 star if fixed. Uninstalling if not.
It doesn't let you put what state you are in, since I'm from a small town, and I know there's plenty of other towns with the same name, I don't have a clue what town it thinks I'm in
Local Weather It worked when I first installed it, but now it's stopped and won't show anything.  It did the same thing on my tablet.
WON'T WORK
Way too limited. Try the Weather Underground app instead.
How do you change from c to f
Can't find city in Florida Uninstalled
Local weather This app is slam Don't have a radar and it's probably not the right reading for it either
Chill If you know what the weather is then download it
Its a load of rubbish. Tried putting my country  city in as it said  says cant be found. Waste of time
