A long way to go... Lots of prblm....left handed batsman cannot play spin at all....fielder in  outfield always catches Even if it is hit by power shot.....a long way to go for before becoming a worth game....uninstalling ..not happy wid performance
Not a good game.. you can't play easily... you will be always catch out on the boundry, even in a big hit also..
Fwj Csb why I was wondering what if how to add to your address and is not intended as a result whole or in any form whatsoever for any damage
It's a nice and good game. It's easy to play but it hanged the phone. I told you that you shouldn't install it
Lot of Improvement needed for Basic Rules Basic rules like player swap side on over change, required run rate calculation,game ending on equalling scores
Awfull game. Too bad u can't play the spinners at all its irritating to loose all ur wickets facing a spinner kindly make some changes so that at least we can play the game and not loose all wickets in two overs of a spinner.
