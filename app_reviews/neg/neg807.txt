Nexus 7 v2 Issues Tried 2 different Next 7 tablets and neither one would connect. Chainfire says it's a tablet issue and not their problem.
Dslr controller 8 for a app that crashes, first thing you see is this is the best app. Why say it still in beta mode and still working on bugs. So why charge then.
No exposure Using Note 3 and Canon 6D and I don't have an exposure meter. Well, it's there, it just doesn't work. It's too slow as well. I need a quick preview of the shot, not a 2min download. Fix those two and it's the best ap ever. EDIT  UNINSTALLED MADE MY 6D GO CRAZY IT WOULDNT STOP FIRING AND WOULDNT RESPOND TO ANYTHING. AP FROZE AS WELL. NO THANKS. Glad my camera is OK. Nice try. Refund asap.
Unreliable If you're looking for an app whose greatest strength is to produce countless communication breakdowns, this certainly is the perfect choice for you. Regardless of the button I push and the device I choose Tablet or Smartphone, the app freezes instantly. I feel badly cheated and would like to receive a full refund
DSLR controller Canon 70D, Nexus 7  2013, and the latest Lollypop latest, still not working with WiFi nor OTG. Update says it fixed the problem with OS 5 but I disagree.
