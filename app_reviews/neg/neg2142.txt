Eats data with video ads If you have limited data per month, stay away from this app. I don't mind ads, but don't eat my data to play them Uses more data than any other app or system app on my S5 device.
Too many ads I don't mind supporting the developer by putting up with ads. But the latest version has gone too far. Ads won't go away and I can't control the audio
Deleting because of video ads I used to love this app but the ads are getting really bad. They're eating up my data.. lose the video ads Ads are part of free games but videos that you are forced to watch is wrong.  I'm deleting this app and I will download a paid version but not yours because I don't agree with video ads
If you don't change error you suck When you want to move a card or a row of cards you have to push exactly in the middle. Often it sucks because you don't push exactly in the middle.
Annoying Ads I'm getting really tired of these ads. You get one every time you shuffle a new deck, which is bearable, but with the latest version, they don't save your preference of being muted. Some ads with volume can't even be skipped for a few seconds. I really enjoy the game, and would gladly pay for an adfree version, but as that is not available I've uninstalled the app. The latest version's ads are just way too intrusive.
Solitaire Not bad but ads are annoying and the auto complete option is unnecessary. If I find a better free solitaire, this one is gone.
Ugh I don't mind ads. I get it that it's  something I have to deal with for it being free. However, I'm SICK AND TIRED of the running ads that require me to exit, end by task manager and then restart the app just to get through one of the unstoppable video ads Either drop the video ones or I'll uninstall and get another solitaire app.
Ad City The game itself is fine, the ads drive me nuts... Update I just redownloaded thae game, same thing... Irritating advertising that eats my data. Uninstalled for the second or is it 3rd time.
