Wont show up in Pic Collage When I load up pic collage it says the app needs to be updated and takes me to the app store where I bought it but wont give me the option to update.  Too bad looks like great effects, but now Im afraid to buy others incase the same thing happens.  Galaxy Note 10.1
Not happy I have loved this App for ever. And All of the plugins, but this one not much. I wish I never paid for this one, there all almost the same. I love,love black  white pictures, but like I said not so much with this one
Below average Only 6 for 1.31, and 2 sets of 2 effects are very similar to each other, so really only 4 included. Very poor
Up date Hate it its the first app I ever bought and last tells me to up date everytime  So I just uninstalled instead
Won't let me open the app
Why no icon in my s4 No icon in my device How ican use this app...
