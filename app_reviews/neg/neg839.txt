Ridiculous U can't even get one letter typed before ads pop up...then u type couple more letters then another ad Not worth it.
Bad Sometime its stop working.... i can say its good before. That's why i give one stars
I installed app on my new phone. Now It won't access all my photos
Hate it Cant use it, adds keep popping up, this app sucks.
Another one thats add after add...i didnt even start doing anything before an ad popped up...uninstalled
Would be great if u could choose photo first then text and auto save and would automatically start from the menu to start over
I would have given 5 stars .... But d problem with the app is , that we have to select font n write d msg before selecting the image.... That's a huge issue..  If u could rectify it... It will b surely d most popular app...
Advert couldn't let me do any thing just pumping up advert every seconds and couldn't save work done if data network turned off
Ads...stretches out picture Title is pretty self explanatory. Hate the constant Ads and stretches out picture when taken out from gallery. Uninstalling.
This app has potential but disappoints. Very hard to put text in a particular place if you have several words in different places. And if you can't get it right and go back to the text box, you lose all other changes. And sometimes you get it perfect finally, load your picture, and the writing has disappeared Meaning you have to start again.
You can not just add pics from your camera
Terrible I wanted to write something to my boyfriend and i cant choose the picture i wanted to chose for him please fix
To many pop ups Every 2 seconds there is an add
Joey Pieterse Difficult to rate this app.  This is not user friendly at all
Awful All around Epic Fail If I could give this app negative stars, I would. The ads are nonstop, unless you disconnect your data or WiFi. It won't allow you to save or share the pic 'with text' you created.
