Progress erased App just exited and my progress was reset to the beginning. I have no desire to play something where I am in constant fear of losing the time I've invested.
Have played first chapter, cool game. But the frame rate drops are insane, becomes more of a slide show presentation
Tried to play But the game won't go past the home screen and then I tried to uninstall pretty much immediately and it didn't refund my money...bad business
