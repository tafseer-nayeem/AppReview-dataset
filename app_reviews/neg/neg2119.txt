Didn't care for it The game functions perfectly. However I downloaded without ever playing the board game. I just don't find the game itself interesting at all. I've played a dozen times. Just don't see how it won awards. There are other euro board games that I find much more enjoyable and interesting to play. Just my opinion, obviously.
Really poorly done Love the game, but this is very poorly done. Lots of ui bugs making it hard to click anywhere. Feels like they only tested on one device and weren't very careful about supporting different screen sizes.  I was excited to see there's online play,but I can't get it to register and account. Bummer.
Close to Perfect Update game unplayable on Nexus 9. Crashes every time I try to play.  This game is pretty much perfect. Just wish there was a way to pick up a piece if you clicked somewhere by accident. Maybe there is a way and I just didn't notice. Either way, 5 stars.
Doesn't matter how much I like the GAME. I like and recommend the GAME but not the APP. If your really want to check this out, buy the tabletop version. At least that won't constantly crash on you midgame. Really wanted to like this. Hopefully an update is forthcoming.
Special actions vanish After collecting a special action, they will vanish at various times for human players. AI opponents never lose their actions which makes it nearly impossible to ever win.
Special actions buggy on last turn Love the game but a bug disables special actions on your last turn. This needs to be corrected as it can ruin a game.
Hangs sometimes, crashes sometimes, artwork doesn't scale Runs slowly and sometimes stops completely, requiring a restart. Crashes a lot too. On top of that some of the artwork doesn't scale so on my new phone some buttons are invisibly small. Overall a pretty halfassed implementation.
