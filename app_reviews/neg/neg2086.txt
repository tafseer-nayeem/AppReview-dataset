This game just wasn't really pulled together It's a shame  it's a cool concept, at least from the description. But the monsters don't chase you if you walk slowly, and once you realize that, they cease to be scary. You can just walk around slowly and explore every map and it kinda loses its ambiance. I dunno. I wanted to like this but it was just... boring. I didn't feel interested to keep playing.
