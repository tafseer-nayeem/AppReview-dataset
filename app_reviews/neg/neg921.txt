Haven't tried it yet I'm gonna start my challenge saturday, but before I do, isn't it bad to do the same workout everyday I thought that wasn't good for the muscle, if so, then I don't really understand how it's a 30 everyday challenge. I will rate it more than a 1 star asap, can't wait to start, will give my progress, and taking before and after pics
