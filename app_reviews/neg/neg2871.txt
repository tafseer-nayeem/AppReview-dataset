Cannot update the app I cannot update this app anymore. Paid app should not be like this. It seems many people have facing the same problem.

Paying for other book I bought this and then paid for an additional ABCs book. So far it's been downloading for over 15 minutes. AVOID THIS APP.  Editors choice my A. It's obviously unattended. No network issues on my end just garbage on their end.
Help can't open app Like any others who have the latest version, the app just can't be opened. After the splash screen, it goes into a black screen and then an error message comes up. Please fix it quickly as my daughter is big fan of your app. It used to work just fine before.
OK but developer does not support Android The iOS version of this app has many more coloring books available for purchase. The developers of this app clearly do not value their Android user base enough to give them the options available on iOS.
