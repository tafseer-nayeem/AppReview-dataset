Infamy Mous Says It's mediocre don't buy I'd say free download because the deaths in hers are inevitable due to the unnecessary fast pace of the game, in other words slow the pace of it down and it'll be a great game
Ehhh It's definitely not a .99 game. It should be free due to the lack of... well... a game. There's a lack of texture and fun, the description says addictive but I can't play it for more than 5 minutes without getting bored or annoyed at how poorly sensitive the controls are. There's nothing much here other than dissapointment.
Sucks Goes so fast, in most circumstances your only option is death. You have to get lucky that you are not in the air at the time you need to jump again. Intro sucks too takes too long to get going again.
Don't download it
Not interesting
Uugh This game is just horrible I just spent  1 on this game, and it's literally one of the worst games I've ever played It doesn't even dignify a response and yet here I am.
Refund Can I get a refund, this game is not for me.
Waste of money Boring
