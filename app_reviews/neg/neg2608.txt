Don't waste your money It dosent work I want my money back it restarts my phone every time I open it wish 0 stars was a choice
Cheap It's fun at first but when you get into it,it freezes my phone then I got to restart just cause it froze.. so f this game but I did enjoy part 1
Used to be fun It won't let me open the app. It automatically closes when I click it. Fix this or give me my refund
Okay if it was free This game is not worth your money. It's boring and I quit after 15 minutes of playing. Can i have my money back please
Shame  Please update your app to improve performance  graphics. Also when you buy an app you should put away advertising  Last update 1 year ago  How is it possible Do something
Paid for game does not work.  I WORK HARD for my money and I WANT IT BACK YOU JERKS
Horrible My son downloaded this game with his allowance money. He can't even play the game because every time he tries, his tablet shuts down. What a rip off. And to top it off, the link to the website connected to  this app goes nowhere. So how do i get our money back Don't buy this game.
To many ads Everything is great but the ad's also if this had exhibition like madden it would be an amazing game
Really.....The game won't even open. The screen is just black. I want my money back or I want the game to work.
very slow and ads I want my money back, this is dreadful
Why are there ads in a game I paid for I don't understand why the developer, Natural Motion games, decided to put ads into a paid game. I don't understand why they felt the need to put ads in a game like this.  It doesn't make any sense I paid 2.99 for this game. Overall fun game but ads in a paid game are ridiculous
I hate it It is real good game but it is all game so can i have a refund
