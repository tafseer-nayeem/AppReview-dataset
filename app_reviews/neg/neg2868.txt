Loved it then hate it I had this game but my deice broke. So I got this game on my new tablet and when I was playing,it froze and my buildings,NBA arena, house ,school and church dissapeered . Get my world back and I will rate 5
UPDATE Love this but it gets boring when you have only the small amount of options to build with. Please add more so we can get more creative and possibly add people  animals etc. Thanks
This game sucks you should be able to save your work I built so many things and it didn't save
Bullshit Paid 4 dollars so I could save my game but there's no save option so basically this upgrade is a scam and I think I know the right person to have you prosecuted because I'm sure several ppl paid for this but we're ripped off.  Fix it or refund our money.
Not alot of blocks to choose from. Also there is not save if you delete the app you have to start completely over Wrong box
Did not save my work I went to play it and all my work was gone and I can't even get a refund for it my dad  wasted 3.99 for and app that doesn't save your work 
Stay tuned Its still downloading...love the lite version but hope this one will let me save my builds
