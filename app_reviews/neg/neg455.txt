Big problem Everytime I change something in my stories . I publish them and the changes dont show up. And it makes me look dumb and mediocre. When I go back to edit them again then the  changes show up in edit mode. But not publish mode. Fix it now please and thank you
Problem For me this is a big problem. I am wrote two chapters of my new story and then after a few hours it vanished Even my story As a writer, this is a major offense to me. I really do love the app but please return my story. I am begging you. Can I have my story back Please reply as soon as possible.
I can't even finish writing my story without it freezing and foreclosing on me. Please fix this and I'll give you your 5 stars
DO NOT UPDATE I UPDATED AND MY CHAPTER WENT MISSING ENTIRELY AFTER I PUBLISH IT. SEGMENTS FROM MY DRAFT DISSAPEARED, LEAVING JUST THE FIRST SENTENCE. SERIOUSLY
Photo Problem I can not change my profile picture. Background picture. Or even a picture for my story I select a photo from my gallery and nothing happens at all. If this problem is fixed I will give it a 3 or 4 star. Until then it stays at 2.
Bad It kept putting half of what I wrote for my prologue on a second page and I couldn't get it back because it kept erasing. Please fix for more stars
