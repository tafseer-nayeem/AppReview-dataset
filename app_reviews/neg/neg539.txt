Hate this Keeps popping up that my address book will upgrade when connected to internet, disrupting whatever I'm doing...I don't want to use or upgrade this app but unless I do, it keeps interrupting me. So frustrating
Aggravating app Won't connect anymore. Connected once but didn't transfer my contacts. Two things it kept telling me  cannot connect to WiFi and stopped working. Then it told me my provider was not allowing phone to phone transfers. Just aggravating
Used to like it Last time I needed to transfer stuff to my new phone, this worked. However, now it isn't working at all. Says it's not responding. Such a shame.  It was suggested that I uninstall the app and powercycle both phone, this allowed it to transfer a few things, however it transferred no contacts, which is basically all I wanted transferred.
Won't work I've tried everything and it won't work on my old phone.  Guess I'll try kies.
Almost pointless It only transfered 40 or so pictures none of my videos and none of contacts iPhone 5s to a note 5
Didn't work Says it transfer but nothing will open
It thinks it worked It disconnected often but it eventually worked all the way through my 8gb.  Switching from a Samsung to an LG it didn't copy any messages or logs even though it thinks it did.
Did not work from a galaxy 3 to a six Edge plus
It would not work
