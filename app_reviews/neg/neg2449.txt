Rs How can you say this game as a best game... i think you should make this game best.. you had added a Truck sound in a Train Engine thats pathatic... and many others uneven things.. The best Train simulator best so far is TRAINZ DRIVER.
Graphics Graphics is always the problem, the scenery is not what I want. I want a detailed scenery, interesting and nice graphics
Brilliant but there's some flaws To many ads and why the hell do I need to sign up through Facebook What about people with no Facebook account  Aside this game is very interesting
Good bt not best I casually downloaded this game as it reminds our journey in train travelling, 3 star for now bcoz its not that WOW game as of now. U can fix some more options in it like track change, and the platform length tobe increase, slow and fast train option u shud add as real experience, and more importantly the train speed shud go above 100kmph. Looking forward for ur new update, if convince then 5 star is fix
Don't have enough things to do Need improvement as other simulator game provide more things to do for the player rather than only driving in a single way.
Not realistic. Meant for 2 year old.... The trains belong to a prehistoric age. Accidents occur if you ace it up. No control on choosing tracks.
Boring  Flat scenery, all countries look the same, all stations look the same and the track bends sharply for no reason when going over flat ground  This is a shame as the engine detail is very good, so I'm sure you  could improve the graphics and add changing the train consist to make the game interesting.
Needs a Lot of Improvement This game has plenty of good features but more than them there are loopholes bad graphics lagging and no Indian locomotivE's
