Advertising Its a complete hassle that every time I go to the main page it asks me to remove ads when that is really the only add that gets in the way...the price for the premium version is way to high....just ahorrible gimmick to make money
What is going on I purchased the ad free one, got a new phone and there's ads. What a freaking surprise Not paying for it again
NAGWARE Floods the phone with useless, annoying ads and constantly begs you to upgrade to an adfree version. Very annoying. Not worth the download.
