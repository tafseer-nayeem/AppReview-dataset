Uninstall Ads pop up while baby is playing ensuring that baby will press them since they take up the whole screen.
Pointless This app is great Really But what's the point if it doesnt lock, and the baby keeps exiting by accident
Not very suitable for a small child. I like the incorporation of animals in the game,  but there should be a lock if there's going to be ads. On top of being so easily clicked out of. Maybe there should be a paid version with these things  Can't really expect it to be perfect when it's free..
SPAM Uninstalling Ad pop ups and if I could give it a 0 i would
Uninstall This app has pop up ads that take the whole screen up so the baby presses the add. There is no child lock for when the baby mistakenly exits. Lose the ads and get the lock I will redownload.
Its Good for sis but It Just Ads and everything bout it and keep doing the Same Thing
Terrible mess Confusion galore. . Don't know what and where to start. . Noisy and adverts popping up like madness
Full screen ads in a baby app, avoid...
Ads in a baby game get me to delete that game.
Deleting because of all the ads There are so many ads, my little girl cant play it
Ridiculous Pop up adds are ridiculous The come up often and take up entire screen
Great app, but the whole ad page it's just stupid
Good Nice game to enjoy kids
