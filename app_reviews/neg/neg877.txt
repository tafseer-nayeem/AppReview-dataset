Used this spp for a year I have trusted this app but not anymore .it has started mixing up names for out going calls and incoming calls for almost two days.i will only give u back 5 star wen this problem is resolved.on my previous phone this app worked so well for one year until my phone died.on my new phone i downloaded this ur app but its not acurate anymore
Rhonda Alexander sent a request for this app...Why I don't even know her.. Not even outside of Facebook... But if you need to contact me Rhonda you should just ask for my number.. Messy people...
This app has associated me with a number that is not my number. I contacted customer support no answer. This app just invades your privacy. There FAQ is just awful it doesn't really help.
Does not work Can't use nothing have to go to regular screen to do anything needs to be fixed asap and can't see all my Facebook friends just what the app wants me to
Invasion of privacy This app was great, up until it started displaying my text messages with my phone being locked Displays sender's name and the message on the locked screen for 510 seconds.
It doesn't show incoming calls for me Can someone help me because I'm using a Sony Xperia z1 and I can't get incoming calls through call app I need help please
Tell me more The problem is l can't receive a call. What should l do
No longer working This App was my favorite but now it's no longer working keep jumping back to normal settings.
Worst app ever It is never correct and then asks you to tell them who is calling you. Ridiculous
Bulshit Downloaded and deleting now. True caller lakhs tym better than this.
I can't do greetings for birthdays  like cards on Facebook I use to with this app
